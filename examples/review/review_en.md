The Independent Jane
For all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.
Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.
The freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.
Although Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.
When accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,
“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”
“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”
“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”
That same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.
“Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”
I find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.
John Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.
Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.
Jefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.
Jane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

### Summary
Jane Austen’s fiction, beneath its romance and social comedy, is fundamentally concerned with freedom and independence — especially intellectual independence and the right to choose one’s own course in life. Her heroines repeatedly embody refusal of social pressure and assertion of personal judgment: Elizabeth Bennet’s rejection of Mr. Collins exemplifies an uncommon moral and intellectual autonomy for the period; her first refusal of Mr. Darcy, though fueled by anger, likewise surprises and discomfits him because it signals that she will not be coerced. Even her eventual acceptance of Darcy is framed as an act of self-determination, taken in defiance of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and against the likely disapproval of her father. By contrast, Anne Elliot’s compliance with Lady Russell’s counsel to refuse Captain Wentworth shows the painful cost when that independence is withheld.

Austen’s novels operate within contemporary social rules, but they repeatedly register—often impatiently—her dissatisfaction with the limited roles available to women. In Emma this frustration becomes explicit: the novel stages moments of outrage at social constraints, notably in exchanges about the “governess-trade.” Jane Fairfax’s ironic comparison of the business of seeking governess posts to a market that sells “not quite human flesh, but… human intellect” exposes the degrading mechanics by which educated women are commodified; Emma’s horror at the idea that Jane might be reduced to a governess underscores how socially humiliating that fate is imagined to be. These scenes dramatize Austen’s critique of a society that forces talented women into precarious, humiliating dependency.

The essay draws a historical parallel: around the time John Adams left for the Continental Congress in December 1775, a baby girl was born in Steventon — the birthdate of Jane Austen. That coincidence is used to compare two very different articulations of liberty. Jefferson’s revolutionary rhetoric and the Declaration that emerged from the American founders advanced public, political declarations of independence and provoked war; Austen’s contribution was quieter and literary. Yet her persistent advocacy for individual moral freedom, responsibility, and the right to determine one’s own life is presented as resonant with the same ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Though Austen was a royalist and never incited military action, her novels are argued to promote fundamental principles of personal liberty and intellectual autonomy in their own subtle, culturally formative way.

- Question: What point does Jane Fairfax make about the “governess-trade” in her exchange with Mrs. Elton?
- Answer: Jane contrasts the governess-trade with the slave trade, implying that while different in guilt, governesses may suffer greater misery as they are effectively selling their intellect and labor.

- Question: How does Emma react when Mrs. Weston reveals Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane Fairfax?
- Answer: Emma is shocked and exclaims that Jane being on the point of going as a governess is a “horrible indelicacy,” unable to conceive such a measure.

### Educational Material
# Jane Austen and the Theme of Independence

## Learning goals
- Identify how independence (of thought, choice, and person) functions as a central theme in Jane Austen’s fiction.
- Analyze key passages that critique social constraints on women in Regency England.
- Compare literary advocacy for personal freedom with political declarations of independence.
- Practice close reading and develop ideas for essays or creative responses focused on autonomy and social expectation.

---

## Historical and literary context (brief)
- Jane Austen was born in December 1775 and wrote during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period of significant political change (American and French Revolutions) and evolving social expectations in Britain.
- Political texts of the era—such as the American Declaration of Independence—argue for natural rights and self-government. Austen’s novels, while not political tracts, repeatedly explore personal liberty: the right to think for oneself, to choose freely in matters of marriage and vocation, and to accept responsibility for those choices.
- Austen’s work often critiques the gendered limitations of her society through irony, social observation, and character conflict rather than overt polemic.

---

## Central idea: independence in Austen’s fiction
Austen’s novels repeatedly dramatize tensions between individual freedom and social expectation. Key aspects include:
- Independence of thought: characters who think for themselves and resist conformist pressure (e.g., Elizabeth Bennet’s refusals; Anne Elliot’s struggle with persuasion).
- Freedom to choose: the right to choose a life partner or a livelihood irrespective of class or family pressure.
- Responsibility: the moral and social consequences of exercising freedom, and the necessity of accepting responsibility for one’s choices.

## Two representative passages and commentary

1) Jane Fairfax on the “governess-trade”
> “Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”  
>  
> “Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”  
>  
> “I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”

Commentary:
- Jane Fairfax’s lines expose the limited economic options for genteel women: the governess role is framed as a market for “human intellect,” a phrase that satirically equates an educated woman’s labor with a commodity.
- The exchange contrasts genteel sensibilities (Mrs. Elton’s shocked tone) with a realist’s bluntness (Jane’s comparison to the slave trade), highlighting Austen’s use of irony and social critique.
- The passage emphasizes both the vulnerability of women who must earn a living and the moral ambiguity of the society that permits this exploitation.

2) Emma’s shock at the idea of Jane becoming a governess
> “Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”

Commentary:
- Emma’s reaction illustrates the prevailing social stigma attached to the position of governess: it’s seen as an “indelicacy” for someone of Jane’s background to consider paid employment.
- Austen uses Emma’s voice to expose snobbery and the gulf between social appearance and ethical concern for individuals’ needs.
- The scene further supports the theme of constrained female agency and the social obstacles to independent livelihood.

## Close-reading exercise (suggested steps)
Passage: the Jane Fairfax “governess-trade” excerpt (above).

1. Read slowly and underline words or phrases that carry strong emotional or ideological weight (e.g., “sale,” “human intellect,” “human flesh,” “victims”).
2. Identify the speakers and their attitudes. How do their tones differ?
3. Analyze the rhetorical moves: Where is Austen ironic or satirical? Where is she direct and moralizing?
4. Consider historical context: What real social conditions does the “governess-trade” evoke?
5. Write a short paragraph (150–200 words) arguing how the passage critiques social limitations on women.

Hint for analysis: Focus on how equating intellect with a commodity both dignifies the work intellectually and condemns the economic system that forces women into it.

---

## Comparative prompt: Austen and political declarations of independence
- Prompt: Compare the way Jane Austen’s novels advocate for personal liberty with the political assertions of natural rights (for example, the American Declaration of Independence). How do literary and political texts differ in audience, method, and immediate effect? How are they similar in values and underlying principles?
- Points to consider:
  - Form: novel vs. political manifesto.
  - Method: indirect social critique (irony, character, dialogue) vs. explicit assertion.
  - Audience and scale of effect: individual moral imagination vs. mass political action.
  - Shared values: agency, responsibility, the right to pursue one’s own life and happiness.

---

## Discussion questions
- How do specific heroines (Elizabeth Bennet, Anne Elliot, Emma Woodhouse, Jane Fairfax) embody different kinds of independence?
- In what ways does Austen show both the benefits and limits of personal freedom in her novels?
- How does Austen use irony and free indirect discourse to make social critique more persuasive?
- Can literary advocacy change social attitudes in ways comparable to political revolutions? Give examples or counterexamples.
- How do class and gender intersect to restrict or enable freedoms in Austen’s world?

7. M2 — Quotation identification: Provide the two-word phrase the author uses to describe the way Jane “screams” her outrage at limitations for women in Emma.
   Answer: “screams her outrage” (the phrase used is “She ‘screams’ her outrage” — the quoted word is screams)

8. M3 — Explain briefly: In the exchange with Mrs. Elton, what distinction does Jane Fairfax draw between the “slave-trade” and the “governess-trade”?
   Answer: Jane Fairfax distinguishes that the guilt of those who carry on the trades differs (implying the slave-trade is more guilty) but argues she does not know where the greater misery of the victims lies — suggesting the governess-trade causes profound misery despite different kinds of guilt.

    Answer: Around the time Austen was born, John Adams left his farm to attend the Continental Congress in Philadelphia (mid-December 1775) — both events occurred at roughly the same time.

Hard (5)
11. H1 — Analytical short essay (approx. 120–150 words): Summarize and evaluate the author’s main argumentative move when comparing Jane Austen and Thomas Jefferson. In your answer, state the thesis and two supporting points the author uses.
    Answer: Thesis: Jane Austen’s impact on freedom and independence is no less important than Jefferson’s. Supporting points: (1) Austen’s writing advocates independence of person and thought and promotes rights and responsibility quietly rather than by violent revolution. (2) While Jefferson’s words instigated war and political change, Austen’s influence is subtler and cultural—she declared and promoted principles similar to Jefferson’s (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness) through literature and social critique. Evaluation: The author argues by analogy—both advanced ideals of independence, though in different spheres and with different methods. The move highlights the moral and cultural influence of literature, but rests on broad equivalence rather than empirical measure of influence. It persuasively reframes Austen’s work as politically expressive, though the comparison risks oversimplifying the different natures and effects of political versus literary action.

12. H2 — Close analysis: Identify and explain the rhetorical effect of the parenthetical aside “not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.” How does it function within the passage quoted?
    Answer: The aside draws a stark comparison between literal slavery and the professional commodification of women’s minds. It uses contrast to shock the reader and to emphasize that selling intellectual labor is akin to selling the person. It also undercuts Mrs. Elton’s trivializing response; the phrase forces readers to consider moral gravity and social irony, heightening sympathy for governesses and critiquing social norms.

13. H3 — Synthesis: List three specific textual examples the author uses to argue Austen champions independence, and explain in one sentence how each example supports the claim.
    Answer: (1) Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins — shows independence of thought by rejecting a socially advantageous marriage. (2) Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Darcy (initially) — demonstrates moral autonomy and resistance to social pressure. (3) Jane Fairfax’s governess-trade remark — exposes structural limitations on women and asserts intellectual agency. Each example illustrates characters resisting social expectation and valuing personal choice.

14. H4 — Interpretation: The author calls Austen an “avowed royalist” but also believes she “firmly believed in [Jefferson’s] declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” What tension does the author imply here and how is it resolved?
    Answer: Tension: Royalism implies loyalty to monarchy and the status quo, while Jeffersonian rights imply revolutionary individual liberties. Resolution: The author suggests Austen reconciles this by promoting personal and social freedoms within her genteel, non-revolutionary context—advocating liberty through literature and moral persuasion rather than political upheaval.

15. H5 — Comparative rhetorical assessment: The author contrasts Jefferson’s “excessive consequence” with Jane’s “quiet, genteel yet powerful way.” Analyze the-choice of adjectives and tone here: what argument is being made about modes of influence, and what implicit value judgment is present?
    Answer: The adjectives contrast overt, large-scale political action (“excessive consequence,” revolution, war) with subtle cultural influence (“quiet, genteel yet powerful”). The argument: both modes effect fundamental change—Jefferson through forceful public action, Austen through moral-cultural persuasion. Implicit value judgment: the author values Austen’s gentler influence and sees it as morally significant and perhaps preferable or at least equally commendable; describing Jefferson’s consequences as “excessive” suggests ambivalence toward violent change.

Instructions: Answer concisely. When asked, quote exact wording from the passage.

Easy (5)
1. E1 — Define in one sentence what the author claims is “really about” Jane Austen’s books.
   Answer: They are really about freedom and independence—independence of thought and the freedom to choose.

2. E2 — Who is shocked and stunned by Elizabeth’s behavior, according to the text?
   Answer: Mr. Darcy

3. E3 — Multiple choice: Which novel is explicitly referenced as showing Austen’s outrage at limitations for women?
   A) Pride and Prejudice
   B) Emma

   D) Sense and Sensibility
   Answer: B) Emma

4. E4 — Short answer: What word does the author place in quotes to describe how Jane expresses outrage in Emma?
   Answer: “screams”

5. E5 — True/False: The author claims Austen incited military action like Jefferson.
   Answer: False — the author explicitly says she did not incite military action.

Medium (5)
6. M1 — Quote identification: Provide the two consecutive words that begin Jane Fairfax’s line about not wanting inquiries by her friends.
   Answer: “I make”

7. M2 — Paraphrase (one sentence): Restate the sentence beginning “Jefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution…” in your own words but preserving the contrast the author makes.
   Answer: Jefferson’s rhetoric spurred and supported an actual political revolution and war, whereas Austen’s influence was subtler and nonviolent.

8. M3 — Short analysis: Why does the author mention John Adams leaving his farm in mid-December 1775? Give the purpose in one sentence.
   Answer: To draw an historical coincidence and set up a comparison between a political founding moment in America and the birth of Austen, highlighting parallel beginnings for influential figures who promoted independence.

9. M4 — Multiple choice: In the Mrs. Elton exchange, who does Mrs. Elton claim was “a friend to the abolition”?
   A) Mr. Suckling
   B) Mr. Collins
   C) Lady Catherine
   D) Mr. Darcy
   Answer: A) Mr. Suckling

10. M5 — Short answer: What responsibility does the author attribute to Austen’s novels regarding rights?
    Answer: They advocate independence of person and thought, the rights of all, and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.

Hard (5)
11. H1 — Close textual proof: Cite (quote) the exact sentence that directly compares Austen’s impact to Jefferson’s.
    Answer: “Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s.”

12. H2 — Critical task: Identify one potential objection a careful reader might raise to the author’s claim that Austen’s impact is “no less important than Jefferson’s,” and compose a one-paragraph rebuttal that the author might offer using language or concepts from the passage.
    Answer: Objection: Jefferson’s political actions led to a revolution and concrete changes in government, while Austen’s literary influence produced no comparable political outcomes. Rebuttal (one paragraph using passage concepts): The author might reply that importance is not measured solely by visible political upheaval; Austen’s subtle influence shaped social ideas about freedom and independence—advocating rights and personal responsibility through characters and moral argument. Though lacking the “excessive consequence” of war, her “quiet, genteel yet powerful way” instigated cultural shifts that support the same principles Jefferson espoused: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

13. H3 — Rhetorical identification: Name two rhetorical strategies the author uses to elevate Austen’s status and briefly explain their effect.
    Answer: (1) Analogy/comparison to founding figures (Jefferson, Adams) — elevates Austen by association with canonical political actors. (2) Juxtaposition of “quiet” influence versus “excessive” political consequence — reframes literary influence as equally valid and morally weighty, making the reader reassess assumptions about power.

14. H4 — Inference: Based solely on the passage, would the author likely agree with this statement — “Austen supports violent revolution to secure liberty”? Explain your answer in one sentence.
    Answer: No; the author stresses Austen did not incite military action and promoted independence in a genteel, nonviolent fashion.

15. H5 — Synthesis/creation: Using no more than two sentences, compose a single topical thesis sentence that would serve as the opening of an essay defending the passage’s principal claim.
    Answer: Jane Austen’s novels, though lacking in overt political theatre, function as powerful engines of social liberty—championing personal autonomy, intellectual agency, and the ethical responsibilities of freedom—and thus deserve recognition comparable to canonical political declarations of independence.

### Active Reading
# Before Reading
- Preview (skim): Title: "The Independent Jane". No subheadings. Short essay comparing Jane Austen’s themes (freedom, independence) with American founders (Adams, Jefferson). Contains quoted dialogue from Austen's novels.  
- Purpose: I’m reading to understand the author’s main argument about Austen’s emphasis on independence and their comparison to Jefferson. I want to be able to summarize and critique the claim.  
- Activate prior knowledge: I know Austen often explores social constraints, marriage, and individual choice (e.g., Elizabeth Bennet, Anne Elliot). I also know Jefferson and Adams were key American independence figures. I’ll watch for evidence linking Austen’s themes to political liberty.

---

> The Independent Jane
>
> For all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.

Thoughts / Margin note:
- Claim up front: Austen’s novels are "really about" freedom and independence. Strong thesis.  
- Question: Does the author mean political freedom or personal/social independence? Likely personal/social, but they may draw a political analogy later.  
- Prediction: Expect examples from Austen’s novels showing characters asserting choice.

Pause & paraphrase: The essay will argue Austen’s true focus is individual freedom and autonomy.

---

> Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.

Margin notes / Reactions:
- Concrete evidence: Elizabeth Bennet refuses proposals twice—good examples of autonomy.  
- Quick connection: Standard interpretation — Elizabeth values self-respect and choice.  
- Question: The author says Darcy is "shocked and stunned" — is that characterization accurate? It fits the novel’s reaction.

Comprehension check: Clear. These are solid textual supports.

---

> The freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.

Thoughts:
- Two contrasting examples: Elizabeth defies social pressure; Anne Elliot initially yields to societal advice.  
- Note nuance: Austen’s characters do both—sometimes they assert independence; sometimes they conform. Author acknowledges complexity.

Question: "unusual even for Austen" — is that true? I’d think Austen’s heroines often negotiate society’s rules, with varying degrees of independence.

---

> Although Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.

Margin notes:
- Strong language: "screams" — signals strong critique of social limits.  
- Observation: Author suggests Austen worked within constraints but embedded critique. That’s a common critical reading.

Personal reaction: I agree that Austen critiques gender norms, though often subtly/satirically rather than overtly.

Pause: Summarize so far — The author argues Austen champions personal freedom; examples include Elizabeth’s refusals and critique of women’s limitations.

---

> When accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,
> 
> “Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”
> 
> “Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”
> 
> “I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”

Active reading notes:
- Quote context: This is from Emma — Jane Fairfax defends the labor market for governesses; calls it “sale ... of human intellect.” Powerful phrase.  
- Reaction: This passage explicitly compares the governess situation to slavery language — strong moral critique of the limited options for women.  
- Question: How does Austen use irony here? Mrs. Elton is comic, Jane Fairfax is self-aware and restrained; the contrast amplifies critique.

Paraphrase: Jane Fairfax points out the harsh reality of women selling labor/intellect for survival; Austen is calling attention to systemic injustice.

---

> That same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.
> 
> “Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”

Notes:
- Emma’s reaction displays social stigma about governesses — implies shame attached to employment for women of certain class.  
- Point: The author uses this to show Austen’s attention to constraints on female independence.

Question / critical thought: Emma’s shock is not necessarily Austen’s endorsement; Austen often uses character irony to critique views. The author seems to recognize that.

---

> I find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.

Reader thought:
- Shift in essay: now a historical parallel — Austen’s birth date aligned with early American revolutionary activity. This signals a comparative argument coming.

Clarify purpose: The author will likely compare Austen’s ideas of freedom with the American struggle for independence.

---

> John Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.

Notes:
- Parallelism: Adams goes to congress; Austen is born. The author wants to draw symbolic parallel between political and literary births of independence.  
- Question: Is this juxtaposition persuasive or rhetorical flourish? It’s evocative but not causal.

Reflection: Nice rhetorical device, but I’ll look for substantive connections (themes, rhetoric) beyond coincidence of dates.

---

> Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.

Margin notes:
- Bold claim: Equating Austen’s impact with Jefferson’s.  
- Critical question: Jefferson’s influence shaped political institutions and violent revolution; Austen influenced social attitudes, manners, and literary culture. Are these comparable? The author asserts yes, in kind but different scale.

Consider evidence needed: I expect the author to argue that both promote ideas of personal liberty, albeit in different spheres.

---

> Jefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.

Active reading:
- Acknowledgement of difference in consequences: good—author admits Jefferson’s actions were political and violent, Austen’s were social/literary.  
- Claim: Austen "declared and promoted the same principles"—liberty and self-regulated independence. This is the core comparative thesis.

Question/Counterpoint: "rights of all" — does Austen explicitly advocate "rights" in a universal sense? Her novels are focused on particular social classes (gentry). Could be an overgeneralization.

---

> Jane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Reader thoughts:
- Tension: Austen as "avowed royalist" yet believer in Jeffersonian rights — interesting juxtaposition but speculative.  
- Question: Do we have direct evidence Austen endorsed Jeffersonian rhetoric? The author says "I doubt not" — that's a belief, not a documented fact.

Critical note: This last sentence is more interpretive/hypothetical than demonstrative. It’s permissible in an essay but weaker as proof.

---

Pause — quick mid-read summary (in my own words):
- The essay argues Austen’s novels center on personal freedom and independence, using examples like Elizabeth Bennet and Jane Fairfax to show resistance to social limits. The author rhetorically compares Austen’s influence on social ideas of liberty to Jefferson’s political role in American independence, claiming Austen promoted the same principles in quieter, literary form.

Comprehension check: I understand the overall argument; some claims are interpretive and would benefit from more historical evidence.

# After Reading

1. Summary of main ideas (without looking back):
- Austen’s novels, beneath romance, champion independence of thought and choice. Examples include Elizabeth Bennet and Jane Fairfax. The essay parallels Austen’s literary advocacy for personal freedom with American founders’ political advocacy, arguing Austen’s influence is comparably important though subtler.

2. Review of annotations (key points noticed):
- Strong thesis: Austen = freedom/independence theme.  
- Evidence cited: Elizabeth refusing proposals; Jane Fairfax’s governess dialogue; Emma’s reaction to governessing.  
- Rhetorical device: Juxtaposition of Austen’s birth and Adams/Jefferson to draw thematic similarity.  
- Weaknesses: Some claims (Austen’s belief in Jefferson’s declaration; "rights of all") are speculative; scope of Austen’s advocacy may be limited to certain classes.

3. Connections to other reading / knowledge:
- Connects to feminist readings of Austen that highlight constraints on women and marriage as economic necessity.  
- Reminds me of scholarship arguing Austen’s novels critique social structures via irony and free indirect discourse.  
- Comparison to Jefferson is more rhetorical — akin to comparing cultural vs. political revolutions (e.g., Wollstonecraft vs. Jefferson).

4. Remaining questions / critical queries to ask the author:
- What primary evidence (letters, essays) supports the claim Austen endorsed Jeffersonian rights?  
- Is it accurate to say Austen advocated "the rights of all"? How does that square with her novels’ focus on gentry concerns?  
- Can you show more instances where Austen explicitly promotes individual rights beyond social critique of governessing and marriage?

5. Reflection on application — how I might use this:
- Use this essay’s thesis as a springboard for a class discussion on literary vs. political concepts of liberty.  
- For an essay: refine the comparison by distinguishing spheres (political vs. social) and providing historical/contextual support for Austen’s views (letters, contemporary reviews).  
- For close reading: analyze the quoted passages (Jane Fairfax, Emma) and examine Austen’s narrative irony as a vehicle for critique.

6. Personal evaluation and action steps:
- Strengths: Compelling thesis, good textual examples, evocative rhetorical parallels.  
- Improvements: Add historical evidence for Austen’s political beliefs; temper claims that overgeneralize.  
- Next actions: If I were writing a response, I’d gather Austen’s letters and contemporary critical material to test the Jefferson comparison; also consider secondary scholarship on Austen and political thought.

Final thought (thinking process explicit): I started skeptical about equating Austen with Jefferson, but the essay made a persuasive cultural argument: Austen quietly advocated personal autonomy within social constraints. However, to fully endorse the comparison I’d want more documentary support and clearer limits to the claim (Austen’s influence is different in kind and scope from Jefferson’s).

How do you get HIV?
HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person. Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm. It can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus. This can happen during unprotected sex. For example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.
It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.

### Summary
HIV is transmitted when bodily fluids that contain the virus are introduced into an uninfected person. The most commonly mentioned fluids are blood and semen. Semen is the fluid released from a man’s penis during sexual activity and can carry the virus if the person producing it is HIV‑positive. Transmission can therefore occur during unprotected sex when one partner is infected — for example, when sex takes place without a condom and one partner already carries the virus. Another common route is through the sharing of needles among people who inject drugs, where infected blood can pass directly from one person to another.

The text emphasizes a clear distinction between routes that do transmit HIV and ordinary everyday contacts that do not. HIV is not spread by respiratory droplets or casual contact, so coughing and sneezing do not transmit the virus. Likewise, routine social interactions such as kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming in the same pool, or contact with sweat and tears are not means of transmission.

### Q&A
- Question: How is HIV passed on?
- Answer: HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.

- Question: Which bodily fluids are mentioned as able to carry HIV?
- Answer: Blood and semen are mentioned as bodily fluids that can carry HIV.

- Question: What is semen?
- Answer: Semen is the liquid released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm and can be infected with HIV if the person is HIV positive.

- Question: Can HIV be transmitted during unprotected sex?
- Answer: Yes — for example, when two people have sex without using a condom and one partner is already infected.

- Question: Can sharing needles transmit HIV?
- Answer: Yes — HIV can be transmitted between drug users who inject and share needles.

- Question: Can HIV be transmitted by coughing or sneezing?
- Answer: No — HIV cannot be transmitted by coughing or sneezing.

- Question: Can HIV be passed by kissing?
- Answer: No — kissing is not listed as a means of transmitting HIV.

- Question: Can HIV be transmitted through sharing a toilet seat or using a swimming pool?
- Answer: No — HIV cannot be transmitted by sharing a toilet seat or through swimming pools.

- Question: Can sweat or tears transmit HIV?
- Answer: No — sweat and tears are not routes of HIV transmission.

- Question: What does it mean if someone's semen is infected with HIV?
- Answer: It means the person is HIV positive or carrying the AIDS virus, and their semen can carry the virus and potentially infect others.

### Educational Material
# How HIV is passed on — clear facts

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system. If untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS, which is the name given to the advanced stage of HIV infection. Knowing how HIV is — and is not — transmitted helps prevent infection and reduce fear or stigma.

## Main ways HIV is transmitted
HIV can be passed when certain infected bodily fluids enter the bloodstream or mucous membranes of a person who is not infected. The fluids that can carry HIV include:
- Blood
- Semen (fluid released from the penis during ejaculation)
- Vaginal fluids and rectal fluids
- Breast milk

Common transmission routes:
- Unprotected sex (vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom or other barrier) with an HIV-positive person.
- Sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment that is contaminated with infected blood.
- From an HIV-positive person to their child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding (prevention is possible with proper medical care).
- Rarely, through transfusion of infected blood or blood products (very unlikely where blood is screened).

## What does NOT transmit HIV
HIV is not spread by casual everyday contact. It cannot be transmitted through:
- Coughing or sneezing
- Hugging, shaking hands, or casual touching
- Sharing food, drinks, cutlery or plates
- Sharing a toilet seat or using the same shower or swimming pool
- Sweat or tears
- Closed-mouth (social) kissing

Very deep (open-mouth) kissing is extremely unlikely to transmit HIV except in rare situations when both partners have significant bleeding in the mouth.

## How to reduce the risk of HIV
- Use condoms correctly and consistently for vaginal or anal sex; they greatly lower the risk of transmission.
- Never share needles, syringes, or injecting equipment. Use sterile supplies every time.
- Get tested regularly and know your partner’s HIV status.
- If you or your partner is HIV-positive, effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) can suppress the virus to undetectable levels — when the virus is undetectable, it cannot be sexually transmitted (U=U: undetectable = untransmittable).
- People at high risk can use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily medicine that can prevent HIV infection.
- After a possible recent exposure, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an emergency medication that must be started within about 72 hours; seek medical care immediately.

## If you think you were exposed
- Wash the area with soap and water (for a bite or needlestick). Do not use harsh chemicals or attempt to “flush out” wounds.
- Seek medical care urgently — PEP may be an option if started quickly.
- Get tested for HIV and follow up as advised by healthcare providers.

## Testing and treatment
- HIV testing is the only way to know one’s status. Modern tests are accurate and widely available.
- If a test is positive, early treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves health, prevents progression to AIDS, and reduces the risk of passing HIV to others.
- People on effective ART who maintain an undetectable viral load do not sexually transmit HIV.

## Quick myth-busters
- You cannot get HIV from casual contact (hugging, shaking hands).
- You cannot catch HIV from a toilet seat, pool, or shared food.
- Saliva by itself does not transmit HIV in normal social contact.

If you have specific concerns about HIV exposure, testing, or prevention options, consult a healthcare professional or a local sexual health clinic.

10. Short answer: Give one reason the text gives for how unprotected sex can lead to HIV transmission.

Hard (5)
11. Analysis: The text lists “blood or semen” as examples of infected bodily fluid. Based only on the text, is it valid to infer that only blood and semen can transmit HIV? Explain your answer in two sentences.
12. Logical negation: Rewrite the sentence “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.” as a logically equivalent affirmative statement (i.e., without “can't”).
13. Short scenario: Person A had unprotected sex with Person B, who is HIV positive. Person A later uses the same toilet seat as Person B. According to the text, which of these events could have transmitted HIV to Person A? List and justify briefly.
14. Precision: The text uses the phrase “unprotected sex.” Based on the text, what specific example qualifies as protected sex (explicitly or implicitly)?
15. Critical: Identify one sentence in the text that defines or explains a term; quote it and say which term it defines.

Solutions — Exam 1

Easy
1. True. (Text: HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.)
2. B) Semen. (Text explicitly names semen.)
3. penis. (Text: “Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.”)
4. False. (Text lists sharing a toilet seat among things it can't be transmitted by.)
5. Example answers: Unprotected sex; sharing needles between drug users; injection drug use with shared needles. (Any one is acceptable; text mentions unprotected sex and drug users who inject and share needles.)

Medium
6. B) Sharing needles between drug users. (Text explicitly: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
7. Because semen can be infected with HIV when someone is HIV positive, and semen can be passed into an uninfected person during sex. (Paraphrase of text.)
8. False. (Text: “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing…”)
9. blood, semen. (Text names those two.)
10. Because when two people have sex without using a condom and one partner is already infected, infected semen can be passed to the other. (Text explanation.)

Hard
11. No. The text gives blood and semen as examples of infected bodily fluid but does not say “only blood and semen”; it uses the phrase “such as blood or semen,” which implies they are examples, not an exhaustive list.
12. Affirmative: “It is not transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.” (This removes contraction; alternative acceptable: “HIV is not transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.”)
13. Only the unprotected sex could have transmitted HIV; using the same toilet seat could not, according to the text. (Text lists unprotected sex as transmission route and toilet seats among non-transmission routes.)
14. The text implicitly indicates using a condom is protection: “for example when two people have sex without using a condom” — so using a condom qualifies as protected sex. (Answer: using a condom.)
15. Example: “Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.” This sentence defines “semen.”

Exam 2 — Scenario-based and applied reasoning
Instructions: Use only the information given. For scenario answers, justify each answer with a reference to the text.

Easy (5)
1. Yes/No: Can HIV be passed on when infected semen is passed into an uninfected person?
2. Multiple choice: Which is explicitly NOT a transmission route per the text?
   A) Blood contact
   B) Sharing needles
   C) Kissing
   D) Unprotected sex
3. Fill in the blank: Sharing _____ between drug users is listed as a transmission risk.
4. True or False: The text equates HIV and AIDS as the same thing.
5. Short answer: Give one phrase from the text that shows a practical example of unprotected sex.

Medium (5)
6. Case: Two people have sex without a condom; one partner is HIV positive. According to the text, describe in one sentence what can happen.
7. Bold inference: The text mentions “blood or semen.” State whether “blood transfusion” is explicitly listed as a transmission route in the text and justify.
8. Comparison: According to the text, which is more likely to transmit HIV: sharing sweat in a sports locker or sharing needles? Answer and justify.
9. Short answer: List three items/activities the text says do NOT transmit HIV.
10. Concept check: The text mentions “infected bodily fluid.” Paraphrase that phrase in your own words using the text's examples.

Hard (5)
11. Scenario analysis: A public sign states “HIV spreads via kissing.” Using the text, construct a two-sentence correction the sign should display.
12. Logical reasoning: The text says semen “can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” Identify and explain any redundancy or imprecision in that clause using one sentence.
13. Design: You're asked to create a single-sentence public-health warning based strictly on the text that differentiates probable from improbable transmission routes. Write that sentence.
14. Proofreading: The original sentence reads “This can happen during unprotected sex. For example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.” Improve punctuation and/or structure to make the sentence clearer without adding new facts; provide the revised version.
15. Critical scenario: Someone argues “If HIV can't be transmitted by sweat and tears, there is zero risk in any casual contact.” Using the text, write a concise rebuttal (one to two sentences).

Solutions — Exam 2

Easy
1. Yes. (Text: “HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.”)
2. C) Kissing. (Text lists kissing among things it can't be transmitted by.)
3. needles. (Text: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
4. No. (The text mentions “HIV” and “AIDS” but does not equate them; it uses “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus,” which is imprecise — but it does not plainly state they are identical.)
5. “when two people have sex without using a condom” (Exact phrase from the text.)

Medium
6. The infected partner's semen can be passed to the uninfected partner, transmitting HIV. (Directly from text.)
7. No, “blood transfusion” is not explicitly listed; the text mentions blood as an example of infected bodily fluid but gives specific scenarios (unprotected sex, sharing needles) rather than naming transfusion. (Text does not list transfusion.)
8. Sharing needles is more likely to transmit HIV according to the text; sweat is explicitly listed among things it can't be transmitted by. (Text contrast.)
9. Examples: coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat, tears. (Any three of these.)
10. Paraphrase example: “bodily fluids that contain the virus, such as blood or semen.” (Uses text examples.)

Hard
11. Correction: “HIV is not transmitted by kissing; it is transmitted when infected bodily fluids like blood or semen are passed into an uninfected person.” (Two sentences, uses text wording.)
12. The clause repeats the idea: “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus” are redundant and confusing because the term “AIDS” normally refers to the disease stage rather than the virus; the wording conflates virus and disease. (One-sentence explanation.)
13. “HIV is transmitted when infected bodily fluids (for example blood or semen) are passed into an uninfected person (for example via unprotected sex or shared needles), but it is not transmitted by coughing, sneezing, kissing, toilet seats, pools, sweat or tears.” (Single sentence synthesizing text.)
14. Improved punctuation/structure: “This can happen during unprotected sex, for example when two people have sex without using a condom and one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.” (Clarified with commas and “and.”)
15. Rebuttal: “The text limits casual-contact risks — it explicitly says HIV can't be transmitted by sweat, tears, or everyday contact like toilet seats — but it also identifies specific bodily-fluid exposures (blood or semen via unprotected sex or shared needles) as transmission routes.” (One to two sentences.)

   Items: blood, tears, semen, coughing, shared needles, toilet seat
9. Short scenario: Two people share a swimming pool; one is HIV positive. Using text wording, explain whether pool-sharing transmits HIV.
10. Explain: Why does the text mention semen’s role in transmission? Give the functional reason in one sentence.

Hard (5)
11. Create: Compose a multiple-choice question (with 4 choices, one correct) about transmission routes strictly based on the text. Include the correct answer.
12. Analyze language: The text says “when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” Identify two possible problems with that phrasing (briefly).
13. Synthesis: Using only the text, draft a two-line public-health tweet that corrects the myth “HIV spreads through casual contact” and advises one clear preventative measure.
14. Formalization: Translate the following into a single logical implication using plain symbols (use P, Q, R etc.) — “If infected bodily fluid such as blood or semen is passed into an uninfected person, then HIV can be passed on.” State your chosen meanings for symbols.
15. Critical design: Propose one short survey question (yes/no) that would test whether readers understood that sharing needles transmits HIV, and provide the expected correct answer.

Solutions — Exam 3

Easy
1. blood; semen. (Both named in text.)
2. False. (Text lists swimming pools as a non-transmission example.)
3. “when two people have sex without using a condom” (Text provides this example.)
4. B) Injecting and sharing needles. (Text: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
5. coughing, sneezing. (Text: “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.”)

Medium
6. Paraphrase: “HIV is passed on when infected bodily fluids (for example blood or semen) enter an uninfected person.” (One sentence paraphrase.)
7. False — the text explicitly lists sweat among things it can't be transmitted by. (One-line justification.)
8. Can transmit: blood, semen, shared needles. Cannot transmit: tears, coughing, toilet seat. (Matching per text.)
9. Pool-sharing does not transmit HIV; the text lists swimming pools among things it can't be transmitted by. (Uses text wording.)
10. Because semen can carry the virus and is released during sex, making sexual transmission possible when unprotected. (Functional reason per text.)

Hard
11. Example MCQ:
   Question: Which of the following is named in the text as a way HIV can be passed on?
   A) Coughing
   B) Sharing a toilet seat
   C) Sharing needles among people who inject drugs
   D) Swimming together
   Correct answer: C) Sharing needles among people who inject drugs.
12. Two problems: (a) It conflates “HIV” and “AIDS” (disease vs. virus) which is imprecise; (b) saying “carrying the AIDS virus” is ambiguous because the virus is HIV, not typically called “the AIDS virus” in precise language. (Two brief issues.)
13. Tweet (two lines):
   “HIV is not spread by casual contact like hugging, coughing, or pools — it’s passed when infected fluids (e.g., blood or semen) enter another person. Use condoms and avoid sharing needles to reduce risk.” (Two-line tweet, based on text.)
14. Let P = “infected bodily fluid (e.g., blood or semen) is passed into an uninfected person”; Q = “HIV is passed on.” Formal implication: P → Q. (Symbols defined and implication given.)
15. Survey question: “Have you heard that sharing needles between people who inject drugs can transmit HIV? (Yes/No)” Expected correct answer: Yes. (Tests understanding; answer per text.)

Exam 4 — Logical reasoning and error-spotting
Instructions: Answer briefly and base all answers on the information provided.

Easy (5)
1. True/False: The text states that semen carries sperm.
2. Multiple choice: Which of these is NOT listed as safe from HIV transmission?
   A) Tears
   B) Blood
   C) Sweat
   D) Toilet seat
3. Short answer: Name one specific sexual protection implied by the text.
4. True/False: The text explicitly mentions sharing drinking glasses as a transmission route.
5. Fill the blank: “HIV can be passed on when infected bodily _____, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.”

Medium (5)
6. Error detection: The sentence “It can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” contains a redundancy. Explain it in one sentence.
7. Logical classification: Based on the text, is “kissing” classified as a possible transmission route, explicitly non-transmission, or not mentioned? Answer and quote the relevant phrase.
8. Distinguish: The text uses “HIV” and “AIDS virus.” Based solely on the text, is there clear distinction made between the two terms? Explain in one line.
9. Scenario: A nurse says “You can get HIV from sweat during physical contact.” Using the text, write a one-sentence correction the nurse should give to patients.
10. Short answer: Which two activities in the text are given as concrete examples where transmission can happen?

Hard (5)
11. Formal critique: Identify a sentence in the text that is grammatically awkward or ambiguous; rewrite it to remove ambiguity without adding new claims.
12. Inference: The text lists “blood or semen” as examples. Provide two possible logical interpretations of this phrasing (one reading that is narrow, one that is broad).
13. Counterexample task: Provide one plausible everyday action not mentioned in the text that could be mistakenly thought to transmit HIV and explain concisely why the text rules it out or does not rule it out.
14. Construct a syllogism (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) using only ideas from the text that leads to the conclusion “Condoms reduce the chance of passing HIV during sex.” (Keep statements faithful to the text; you may phrase “reduce the chance” as “prevent passage when used” only if justified.)
15. Precision editing: The text says “Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.” Suggest a two-part edit to improve stylistic clarity (state what to change and provide the revised sentence).

Solutions — Exam 4

Easy
1. True. (Text: “Semen ... which carries sperm.”)
2. B) Blood. (Blood is listed as a bodily fluid that can transmit HIV.)
3. Using a condom. (Text example: “without using a condom” implies condoms are protection.)
4. False. (Sharing drinking glasses is not mentioned.)
5. fluid. (Text: “infected bodily fluid”)

Medium
6. The redundancy: “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus” repeats the same idea and conflates disease (AIDS) with the virus (HIV); the phrasing is repetitive and imprecise. (One-sentence explanation.)
7. Explicitly non-transmission. Quote: “It can't be transmitted by things like ... kissing ...” (Text classifies kissing as non-transmission.)
8. No clear distinction; the text uses both terms interchangeably and even says “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus,” creating ambiguity rather than a clear distinction. (One line.)
9. Correction: “No — HIV is not transmitted by sweat; the text lists sweat among things it cannot be transmitted by.” (One sentence.)
10. Unprotected sex (sex without a condom) and drug users injecting and sharing needles. (Two activities given.)

Hard
11. Problematic sentence: “It can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” Rewritten: “Semen can be infected with HIV when a person is HIV positive.” (Removes redundancy and ambiguity, does not add facts.)
12. Narrow reading: Only blood and semen transmit HIV (interpreting “such as” as exhaustive). Broad reading: Blood and semen are examples among other infected bodily fluids that can transmit HIV. (Two interpretations.)
13. Example: Sharing a drinking glass — many may think saliva transmits HIV, but the text rules out kissing and lists fluids like sweat and tears as non-transmission, so it implies casual saliva contact is not a listed route. (Explains why text rules it out.)
14. Syllogism:
   Major premise: HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid (such as semen) is passed into an uninfected person.
   Minor premise: Using a condom prevents semen from being passed into another person during sex.
   Conclusion: Therefore, using a condom reduces the chance of passing HIV during sex.
   (This stays faithful: the text contrasts “without using a condom” as risky, so the minor premise is implied.)
15. Two-part edit: (a) Remove the extra “which” and split clauses for clarity. (b) Revised sentence: “Semen is the liquid released from a man's penis during sex; it carries sperm.” (Provides clearer punctuation and removes redundancy.)

9. Classification: From the text, classify “blood” and “toilet seat” as either “transmission” or “non-transmission.”
10. Short example: Give one sentence from the text that begins with “It can't be transmitted…”

Hard (5)
11. Debate prep: Write two one-sentence arguments (pro and con) for the statement “Public signs should state ‘HIV is not contagious’” — use only the text to craft each argument.
12. Redrafting: The fragment “This can happen during unprotected sex. For example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.” is clumsy. Produce a single clear sentence that preserves all facts from the fragment.
13. Abstract reasoning: The text lists specific non-transmission items (e.g., swimming pools). Explain in two sentences how such a list limits but does not eliminate the need for clear general rules in public education. (Base the reasoning on the text’s approach.)
14. Construct a two-question true/false mini-quiz (two T/F statements) that tests whether students know both a transmission route and a non-route from the text; provide correct answers and one-line justifications.
15. Synthesis and wording: Compose one precise, single sentence summary of the whole text that could be used in a brochure header (keep to the facts given and avoid added claims).

Solutions — Exam 5

Easy
1. B) Semen. (Text names semen.)
2. False. (Text lists sneezing among non-transmission examples.)
3. Sharing needles between drug users. (Text: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
4. kissing. (Text: “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing…”)
5. “HIV positive” or “carrying the AIDS virus.” (Text uses these phrases.)

Medium
6. Example slogan: “Use a Condom.” (Three words; based on text's mention of condom protection.)
7. Because drug users who inject and share needles can pass infected bodily fluid (blood) directly, transmitting HIV. (One sentence.)
8. False — the text says semen “can be infected,” which implies it is not always infectious. (One-sentence justification.)
9. blood = transmission; toilet seat = non-transmission. (Classification per text.)
10. “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.” (Exact sentence from text.)

Hard
11. Pro argument: “The text emphasizes that HIV is not spread by casual contact (coughing, kissing, pools, etc.), so a simple ‘HIV is not contagious’ sign could correct common myths.” Con argument: “The text also specifies precise transmission routes (blood, semen, unprotected sex, shared needles), so saying only ‘not contagious’ risks understating the real transmission risks and confusing people about when it can be passed on.” (Two one-sentence arguments based on text.)
12. Single clear sentence: “This can happen during unprotected sex — for example, when two people have sex without using a condom and one partner is already infected — or between drug users who inject and share needles.” (Preserves facts, improves flow.)
13. The text’s list of non-transmission items shows concrete counterexamples to common misconceptions, which helps clarify what is safe. However, because the list names specific items rather than stating a general rule, educators still need clear overarching guidance (e.g., avoid exposure to infected bodily fluids) to cover situations not explicitly listed. (Two sentences, reasoning from text approach.)
14. Mini-quiz:
    Statement 1: “Sharing needles between people who inject drugs can transmit HIV.” — True. Justification: Text explicitly lists this as a transmission route.
    Statement 2: “Swimming in the same pool as an HIV-positive person can transmit HIV.” — False. Justification: Text explicitly lists swimming pools among things it can't be transmitted by.
15. Brochure header sentence: “HIV is passed when infected bodily fluids (for example blood or semen) enter an uninfected person (for example via unprotected sex or shared needles); it is not spread by casual contact like coughing, kissing, toilet seats, pools, sweat, or tears.” (Single precise summary staying within facts of text.)

### Active Reading
# Active reading — interleaved with the document
(Reader voice / thoughts are shown as "Thinking:" and margin-style annotations follow each quoted passage.)

## Before Reading
- Preview: Heading says "How do you get HIV?" — looks like a short explanation of transmission. No subheadings or visuals.
- Purpose: I want to confirm accurate transmission routes and identify any common myths.
- Activate prior knowledge: I know HIV is transmitted through certain body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal/rectal fluids, breast milk), not by casual contact (hugging, sharing toilets, saliva generally low risk). Condoms and not sharing needles reduce risk.

---

## During Reading

> How do you get HIV?

Thinking: This is the central question. I’ll turn it into a more specific question: "What body fluids and activities transmit HIV?"

Margin note: Expect clear list of fluids and activities; check for accuracy and any misleading phrasing.

---

> HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.

Thinking: OK — mentions blood and semen. Is it a complete list?

Annotations / Questions:
- Which other bodily fluids? (vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, breast milk are also important.)
- "Passed into an uninfected person" — clarify routes (sex, needle sharing, mother-to-child).
- Visualize: blood from a needle, semen during sex, breast milk feeding an infant.

Quick clarification (margin): HIV transmission requires specific fluids in sufficient quantity and access to the bloodstream or mucous membranes. Casual contact is not a risk.

Pause & summarize: This sentence names two fluids but misses others. I should watch for that later.

---

> Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.

Thinking: Basic biology explanation. Makes sense, but language could be more inclusive.

Annotations:
- Inclusive note: Semen is produced by people with male reproductive anatomy; sexual partners can include people of any gender.
- This explains why semen can transmit HIV (it can contain the virus).

Question: Does vaginal fluid carry virus too? (Expected answer: yes.)

---

> It can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.

Thinking: This sentence is confusing and partly incorrect.

Annotations / Corrections:
- Terminology correction: AIDS is not a virus. HIV is the virus; untreated HIV infection can progress to AIDS (the advanced stage of illness).
- Better phrasing: "Semen (or other fluids) can contain HIV when a person is HIV-positive."
- Question to self: What’s the difference between being HIV-positive and having AIDS? (HIV-positive = infected with the virus; AIDS = late stage with certain infections/low CD4 count.)

Action: If writing or explaining this to others, correct the wording to avoid misinformation.

---

> This can happen during unprotected sex. For example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.

Thinking: Good — notes major transmission routes: unprotected sex and needle sharing.

Annotations / Notes:
- Add more specificity: unprotected vaginal, anal, or (less commonly) oral sex may transmit HIV — anal sex has higher transmission risk than vaginal sex.
- Injecting drug use: sharing needles/syringes is a well-known high-risk route.
- Prevention reminders: condoms (used correctly), clean needle programs, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), antiretroviral treatment to suppress viral load (undetectable = untransmittable, U=U).

Pause & summarize: This paragraph correctly identifies common ways HIV spreads. I should note prevention options to apply this info.

---

> It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.

Thinking: Good — dispels common myths. But some small nuances are worth noting.

Annotations / Clarifications:
- Agree: casual contact (coughing, sneezing, sharing toilets, pools, sweat, tears) does not transmit HIV.
- Kissing: deep, open-mouth kissing with significant bleeding from mouth/gums is extremely unlikely but could theoretically pose risk if blood is exchanged; ordinary kissing is safe.
- Emphasize: HIV is not spread by air, water, saliva (in normal amounts), or casual touch.

Question: Should I look up official sources (WHO, CDC) for precise phrasing? — Yes, for authoritative language when sharing.

Pause & quick summary: The document correctly lists non-transmission routes and helps reduce stigma.

---

## Short running summary so far (in my own words)
Thinking: Summarizing helps retention.

- HIV is transmitted through certain infected body fluids (mentioned: blood and semen; in reality also vaginal/rectal fluids and breast milk) via activities that allow those fluids to enter another person's bloodstream or mucous membranes (unprotected sex, shared needles, mother-to-child).
- HIV is not transmitted by casual contact like coughing, sneezing, or sharing toilets; kissing is safe in usual circumstances.
- Correct important terminology: HIV = virus; AIDS = advanced disease stage caused by untreated HIV.

---

## After Reading

1. Summarize main ideas (without looking back)
Thinking: I'll restate the key points from memory.
- HIV spreads through specific infected fluids (blood, semen, vaginal/rectal fluids, breast milk) during unprotected sex, needle sharing, and from mother to baby.
- Casual contact does not transmit HIV.
- Prevention includes condoms, not sharing needles, testing, treatment (ART), and preventive meds like PrEP.

2. Review annotations
- Noted missing fluids (vaginal/rectal fluids, breast milk) in the document.
- Corrected misleading phrasing about "AIDS virus."
- Highlighted nuance about kissing and extremely low-risk situations.

3. Make connections
Thinking: Connect to what I know and actions I could take.
- If I or someone I know could be at risk, encourage testing and consider PrEP.
- When educating others, emphasize both accurate transmission routes and prevention, and correct myths to reduce stigma.

4. Generate questions (things I'm still wondering)
- What are the exact relative risks of different sexual activities (insertive/receptive anal/vaginal/oral)?
- How effective are condoms at preventing HIV transmission (typical vs perfect use)?
- What local resources provide testing, PrEP, or clean needle services?

5. Reflect on application
- If sharing this document with others, I would correct the AIDS/HIV wording and add the other bodily fluids.
- I could use this to start a short myth-busting handout: list accurate transmission routes and common non-routes.

Final personal action steps:
- Look up CDC or WHO pages to copy exact, authoritative definitions and prevention guidance.
- If needed, get tested or help someone find testing and prevention services.

-- End of active reading simulation.

Take the complexity of technology and stir in the complexity of the legal system and what do you get? Software licenses! If you've ever attempted to read one you know how true this is, but you have to know a little about software licensing even if you can't parse all of the fine print.
By: Chris Peters
March 10, 2009
A software license is an agreement between you and the owner of a program which lets you perform certain activities which would otherwise constitute an infringement under copyright law. The software license usually answers questions such as:
The price of the software and the licensing fees, if any, are sometimes discussed in the licensing agreement, but usually it's described elsewhere.
If you read the definitions below and you're still scratching your head, check out Categories of Free and Non-Free Software which includes a helpful diagram.
Free vs Proprietary:
When you hear the phrase "free software" or "free software license," "free" is referring to your rights and permissions ("free as in freedom" or "free as in free speech"). In other words, a free software license gives you more rights than a proprietary license. You can usually copy, modify, and redistribute free software without paying a fee or obtaining permission from the developers and distributors. In most cases "free software" won't cost you anything, but that's not always the case – in this instance the word free is making no assertion whatsoever about the price of the software. Proprietary software puts more restrictions and limits on your legal permission to copy, modify, and distribute the program.
Free, Open-Source or FOSS?
In everyday conversation, there's not much difference between "free software," "open source software," and "FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software)." In other words, you'll hear these terms used interchangeably, and the proponents of free software and the supporters of open-source software agree with one another on most issues. However, the official definition of free software differs somewhat from the official definition of open-source software, and the philosophies underlying those definitions differ as well. For a short description of the difference, read Live and Let License. For a longer discussion from the "free software" side, read Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software. For the "open-source" perspective, read Why Free Software is Too Ambiguous.
Public domain and copyleft.
These terms refer to different categories of free, unrestricted licensing. A copyleft license allows you all the freedoms of a free software license, but adds one restriction. Under a copyleft license, you have to release any modifications under the same terms as the original software. In effect, this blocks companies and developers who want to alter free software and then make their altered version proprietary. In practice, almost all free and open-source software is also copylefted. However, technically you can release "free software" that isn't copylefted. For example, if you developed software and released it under a "public domain" license, it would qualify as free software, but it isn't copyleft. In effect, when you release something into the public domain, you give up all copyrights and rights of ownership.
Shareware and freeware.
These terms don't really refer to licensing, and they're confusing in light of the discussion of free software above. Freeware refers to software (usually small utilities at sites such as Tucows.com) that you can download and install without paying. However, you don't have the right to view the source code, and you may not have the right to copy and redistribute the software. In other words, freeware is proprietary software. Shareware is even more restrictive. In effect, shareware is trial software. You can use it for a limited amount of time (usually 30 or 60 days) and then you're expected to pay to continue using it.
End User Licensing Agreement (EULA).
When you acquire software yourself, directly from a vendor or retailer, or directly from the vendor's Web site, you usually have to indicate by clicking a box that you accept the licensing terms. This "click-through" agreement that no one ever reads is commonly known as a EULA. If you negotiate a large purchase of software with a company, and you sign a contract to seal the agreement, that contract usually replaces or supersedes the EULA.
Most major vendors of proprietary software offer some type of bulk purchasing and volume licensing mechanism. The terms vary widely, but if you order enough software to qualify, the benefits in terms of cost and convenience are significant. Also, not-for-profits sometimes qualify for it with very small initial purchases.
Some of the benefits of volume licensing include:
Lower cost. As with most products, software costs less when you buy more of it.
Ease of installation. Without volume licenses, you usually have to enter a separate activation code (also known as a product key or license key) for each installed copy of the program. On the other hand, volume licenses provide you with a single, organisation-wide activation code, which makes it much easier to find when you need to reinstall the software.
Easier tracking of licenses. Keeping track of how many licenses you own, and how many copies you've actually installed, is a tedious, difficult task. Many volume licensing programs provide an online account which is automatically updated when you obtain or activate a copy of that company's software. These accounts can also coordinate licensing across multiple offices within your organisation.
To learn more about volume licensing from a particular vendor, check out some of the resources below:
Qualified not-for-profits and libraries can receive donated volume licenses for Microsoft products through TechSoup. For more information, check out our introduction to the Microsoft Software Donation Program, and the Microsoft Software Donation Program FAQ. For general information about the volume licensing of Microsoft software, see Volume Licensing Overview.
If you get Microsoft software from TechSoup or other software distributors who work with not-for-profits, you may need to go to the eOpen Web site to locate your Volume license keys. For more information, check out the TechSoup Donation Recipient's Guide to the Microsoft eOpen Web Site.
Always check TechSoup Stock first to see if there's a volume licensing donation program for the software you're interested in. If TechSoup doesn't offer that product or if you need more copies than you can find at TechSoup, search for "volume licensing not-for-profits software" or just "not-for-profits software." For example, when we have an inventory of Adobe products, qualifying and eligible not-for-profits can obtain four individual products or one copy of Creative Suite 4 through TechSoup. If we're out of stock, or you've used up your annual Adobe donation, you can also check TechSoup's special Adobe donation program and also Adobe Solutions for Nonprofits for other discounts available to not-for-profits. For more software-hunting tips, see A Quick Guide to Discounted Software Programs.
Pay close attention to the options and licensing requirements when you acquire server-based software. You might need two different types of license – one for the server software itself, and a set of licenses for all the "clients" accessing the software. Depending on the vendor and the licensing scenario, "client" can refer either to the end users themselves (for example, employees, contractors, clients, and anyone else who uses the software in question) or their computing devices (for example, laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, PDAs, etc.). We'll focus on Microsoft server products, but similar issues can arise with other server applications.
Over the years, Microsoft has released hundreds of server-based applications, and the licensing terms are slightly different for each one. Fortunately, there are common license types and licensing structures across different products. In other words, while a User CAL (Client Access License) for Windows Server is distinct from a User CAL for SharePoint Server, the underlying terms and rights are very similar. The TechSoup product pages for Microsoft software do a good job of describing the differences between products, so we'll focus on the common threads in this article.
Moreover, Microsoft often lets you license a single server application in more than one way, depending on the needs of your organisation. This allows you the flexibility to choose the licenses that best reflect your organisation's usage patterns and thereby cost you the least amount of money. For example, for Windows Server and other products you can acquire licenses on a per-user basis (for example, User CALs) or per-device basis (for example, Device CALs).
The license required to install and run most server applications usually comes bundled with the software itself. So you can install and run most applications "out of the box," as long as you have the right number of client licenses (see the section below for more on that). However, when you're running certain server products on a computer with multiple processors, you may need to get additional licenses. For example, if you run Windows Server 2008 DataCenter edition on a server with two processors, you need a separate license for each processor. SQL Server 2008 works the same way. This type of license is referred to as a processor license. Generally you don't need client licenses for any application that's licensed this way.
Client Licenses for Internal Users
Many Microsoft products, including Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, require client access licenses for all authenticated internal users (for example, employees, contractors, volunteers, etc.). On the other hand, SQL Server 2008 and other products don't require any client licenses. Read the product description at CTXchange if you're looking for the details about licensing a particular application.
User CALs: User CALs allow each user access to all the instances of a particular server product in an organisation, no matter which device they use to gain access. In other words, if you run five copies of Windows Server 2008 on five separate servers, you only need one User CAL for each person in your organisation who access those servers (or any software installed on those servers), whether they access a single server, all five servers, or some number in between. Each user with a single CAL assigned to them can access the server software from as many devices as they want (for example, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, etc.). User CALs are a popular licensing option.
Device CALs: Device CALs allow access to all instances of a particular server application from a single device (for example, a desktop computer, a laptop, etc.) in your organisation. Device CALs only make sense when multiple employees use the same computer. For example, in 24-hour call centres different employees on different shifts often use the same machine, so Device CALs make sense in this situation.
Choosing a licensing mode for your Windows Server CALs: With Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, you use a CAL (either a User CAL or a Device CAL) in one of two licensing modes: per seat or per server. You make this decision when you're installing your Windows Server products, not when you acquire the CALs. The CALs themselves don't have any mode designation, so you can use either a User CAL or a Device CAL in either mode. Per seat mode is the default mode, and the one used most frequently. The description of User CALs and Device CALs above describes the typical per seat mode. In "per server" mode, Windows treats each license as a "simultaneous connection." In other words, if you have 40 CALs, Windows will let 40 authenticated users have access. The 41st user will be denied access. However, in per server mode, each CAL is tied to a particular instance of Windows Server, and you have to acquire a new set of licenses for each new server you build that runs Windows. Therefore, per server mode works for some small organisations with one or two servers and limited access requirements.
You don't "install" client licenses the way you install software. There are ways to automate the tracking of software licenses indirectly, but the server software can't refuse access to a user or device on licensing grounds. The licenses don't leave any "digital footprint" that the server software can read. An exception to this occurs when you license Windows Server in per server mode. In this case, if you have 50 licenses, the 51st authenticated user will be denied access (though anonymous users can still access services).
Some key points to remember about client licensing:
The licensing scenarios described in this section arise less frequently, and are too complex to cover completely in this article, so they're described briefly below along with more comprehensive resources.
You don't need client licenses for anonymous, unauthenticated external users. In other words, if someone accesses your Web site, and that site runs on Internet Information Server (IIS), Microsoft's Web serving software, you don't need a client license for any of those anonymous users.
If you have any authenticated external users who access services on your Windows-based servers, you can obtain CALs to cover their licensing requirements. However, the External Connector License (ECL) is a second option in this scenario. The ECL covers all use by authenticated external users, but it's a lot more expensive than a CAL, so only get one if you'll have a lot of external users. For example, even if you get your licenses through the CTXchange donation program, an ECL for Windows Server 2008 has an £76 administrative fee, while a User CAL for Windows Server 2008 carries a £1 admin fee. If only a handful of external users access your Windows servers, you're better off acquiring User CALs. Also, an ECL only applies to external users and devices. In other words, if you have an ECL, you still have to get a CAL for all employees and contractors.
Even though Terminal Services (TS) is built into Windows Server 2003 and 2008, you need to get a separate TS CAL for each client (i.e. each user or each device) that will access Terminal Services in your organisation. This TS license is in addition to your Windows Server CALs.
Microsoft's System Centre products (a line of enterprise-level administrative software packages) use a special type of license known as a management license (ML). Applications that use this type of licensing include System Center Configuration Manager 2007 and System Center Operations Manager 2007. Any desktop or workstation managed by one of these applications needs a client management license. Any server managed by one of these applications requires a server management license, and there are two types of server management licenses – standard and enterprise. You need one or the other but not both. There are also special licensing requirements if you're managing virtual instances of Windows operating systems. For more information, see TechSoup's Guide to System Center Products and Licensing and Microsoft's white paper on Systems Center licensing.
Some Microsoft server products have two client licensing modes, standard and enterprise. As you might imagine, an Enterprise CAL grants access to more advanced features of a product. Furthermore, with some products, such as Microsoft Exchange, the licenses are additive. In other words, a user needs both a Standard CAL AND an Enterprise CAL in order to access the advanced features. See Exchange Server 2007 Editions and Client Access Licenses for more information.
With virtualisation technologies, multiple operating systems can run simultaneously on a single physical server. Every time you install a Microsoft application, whether on a physical hardware system or a virtual hardware system, you create an "instance" of that application. The number of "instances" of particular application that you can run using a single license varies from product to product. For more information see the Volume Licensing Briefs, Microsoft Licensing for Virtualization and the Windows Server Virtualization Calculator. For TechSoup Stock products, see the product description for more information.
There are a lot of nuances to Microsoft licensing, and also a lot of excellent resources to help you understand different scenarios.

### Summary
CTComms sends on average 2 million emails monthly on behalf of over 125 different charities and not for profits.

A software license is a legal agreement between the user and the owner of a program that grants specific permissions that would otherwise be restricted by copyright law. Typical licensing agreements spell out who may use the software, how it may be used, whether it can be copied or modified, and under what conditions it may be redistributed; pricing or licensing fees are sometimes included but frequently are documented separately.

Key licensing categories and terms
- Free vs. proprietary: “Free software” refers to freedoms and permissions (free as in freedom), not necessarily price. Free software licenses usually allow copying, modification, and redistribution without requiring payment or additional permission. Proprietary software imposes restrictions on copying, modification, and redistribution.
- Free, open-source, FOSS: In everyday use these terms are often interchangeable, but their official definitions and underlying philosophies differ. Proponents of each camp largely agree on practical matters, yet there are conceptual distinctions between “free software” (emphasizing user freedoms) and “open source” (emphasizing methodology and development model).
- Copyleft vs. public domain: Copyleft licenses grant the usual free-software freedoms but require that derivative works be released under the same license terms, preventing the code being turned proprietary. Public domain relinquishes copyright entirely and is not copyleft; software in the public domain is free but without the copyleft requirement.
- Freeware and shareware: These are marketing labels rather than formal licensing categories. Freeware is typically proprietary software available at no cost but without source-code access or redistribution rights. Shareware is trial software that can be used temporarily (e.g., 30–60 days) and requires payment for continued use.

End User License Agreement (EULA)
- EULAs are the common click-through agreements presented when acquiring software directly from a vendor or website. For large, negotiated purchases a signed contract typically supersedes a vendor’s standard EULA.

Volume licensing: benefits and practicalities
- Major proprietary vendors commonly offer volume licensing for organisations, with cost and administrative benefits:
  - Lower cost per copy when purchased in volume.
  - Easier installation via organisation-wide activation codes instead of individual product keys.
  - Simplified license tracking, often through online accounts that log activations and coordinate between offices.
- Not-for-profit organisations often qualify for donation or discounted volume-license programs via intermediaries such as TechSoup. Examples include Microsoft donation programs, Microsoft eOpen for locating volume license keys, Adobe donation programs, and vendor-specific nonprofit discount pages.
- Always check donated/discounted stock first (e.g., TechSoup Stock). If stock is insufficient, search for vendor nonprofit programs or reseller volume-licensing offers.

Server software licensing: types and common patterns
- Server applications generally include the license to install and run the server software, but often require additional client licenses for users or devices that access the server.
- Processor licensing: Some server editions (e.g., Windows Server Datacenter or certain SQL Server editions) require a license per processor on the physical host; these are commonly used instead of client licenses for heavily virtualised or high-density servers. Processor-licensed products typically do not require CALs.
- Licensing terminology and options are product-specific, but common structures recur across Microsoft server offerings. Microsoft often provides multiple licensing models for the same server product so organisations can select the most cost-effective scheme for their usage patterns (e.g., per-user vs per-device).

Client Access Licenses (CALs)
- Internal authenticated users (employees, contractors, volunteers) often require CALs for many Microsoft server products (e.g., Windows Server 2003/2008). Some products (e.g., SQL Server in some licensing modes) do not require CALs.
- User CALs: Assigned to a named user, allowing that person to access all instances of the server product from any number of devices. Useful when users need access from multiple devices.
- Device CALs: Assigned to a device, allowing any number of users to access the server from that device. Useful in shift-work environments or shared-terminal scenarios.
- Modes for Windows Server CAL usage: When installing Windows Server you choose a licensing mode—per seat (default) or per server. CALs themselves are not marked by mode and can be used in either. Per server mode treats CALs as simultaneous-connection seats tied to a specific server instance; it can make sense for small setups with limited servers and connection counts.

Practical CAL and server licensing facts
- CALs aren’t “installed” on servers; server software generally cannot enforce licensing by denying access based on license counts, except in per-server mode where the server enforces simultaneous-connection limits.
- Anonymous, unauthenticated external users (e.g., website visitors to an IIS-hosted site) do not require CALs.
- Authenticated external users can be covered either by individual CALs or by an External Connector License (ECL). ECLs cover all authenticated external users but are often much more expensive; they are cost-effective only when many external users need authenticated access. ECLs do not replace CALs for internal staff—employees and contractors still need CALs.
- Terminal Services/Remote Desktop Services (TS/RDS) requires separate TS CALs (in addition to standard Windows Server CALs) for each user or device accessing Terminal Services functionality.
- Microsoft System Center products use management licenses (MLs): desktops/workstations managed by these products require client MLs; servers managed require a server management license (standard or enterprise). There are special licensing considerations for managing virtualized instances.
- Standard vs Enterprise CALs: Some products have both standard and enterprise CALs; enterprise CALs unlock advanced features and may be additive (i.e., a user may require both a Standard CAL and an Enterprise CAL to use advanced functionality, as with some Exchange Server editions).

Virtualisation and instances
- Virtualisation allows multiple operating systems (instances) to run on a single physical server. Each deployed instance of Microsoft software typically counts for licensing purposes. The number of instances allowed per license varies by product and licensing program. Organisations must review product-specific virtualization licensing rules (e.g., Microsoft Volume Licensing briefs, Windows Server virtualization calculators) when designing virtual environments.

Resources, nuances and practical guidance
- Microsoft licensing contains many nuances across versions and products; common threads exist but product documentation and vendor resources should be consulted for precise guidance.
- TechSoup and similar nonprofit-focused intermediaries are valuable resources for donated or discounted licenses, instructions on retrieving volume license keys (e.g., eOpen), and guidance on product-specific licensing scenarios.
- When acquiring server-based software, pay attention to both server licenses and any necessary client/access licenses; determine whether client licenses should be per-user, per-device, or covered by special connectors or external licenses to find the most economical and compliant option.

### Educational Material
# Understanding Software Licensing: Key Concepts and Practical Guidance

Software licensing determines what you may legally do with a program — what you can install, copy, modify, redistribute, or use in a given context. This guide explains common license types, how to choose licensing for servers and clients, and practical tips for organisations (especially nonprofits and libraries) when acquiring software.

---

## Core definition
- Software license: a legal agreement between you and the software owner that grants certain permissions which would otherwise be restricted by copyright law (e.g., copying, installing, modifying, distributing).

---

## License categories and common terms

### Free vs. Proprietary
- Free software: refers to freedoms (use, copy, modify, redistribute), not necessarily price. Free software licenses grant broader rights.
- Proprietary software: restricts rights (often no source code access, limited copying/redistribution).

### Free, Open Source, FOSS
- Free software, open source, and Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) are often used interchangeably in conversation. Official definitions and philosophies differ, but all generally allow access to source code and redistribution.

### Copyleft vs Public Domain
- Copyleft: a form of free license that requires derivative works to be distributed under the same license terms. Prevents downstream proprietization.
- Public domain: the author relinquishes copyright; the work can be used without restrictions. Public domain is free but not copyleft.

### Freeware and Shareware (misleading terms)
- Freeware: free to obtain/use but typically proprietary (no source code access, limited redistribution rights).
- Shareware: usually trial or limited-time software that requires payment to continue use; proprietary.

### End User License Agreement (EULA)
- Click-through agreements that users accept when installing or downloading software. For enterprise purchases, a signed contract typically supersedes a EULA.

---

## Volume and Donation Licensing: why it matters for organisations
Buying many copies or using donated/licensed programs for a whole organisation often uses volume licensing. Benefits include:
- Lower cost per copy.
- Easier installation (single organisation-wide activation codes).
- Centralised tracking of licenses (often via online accounts).
- Special donation/discount programs exist for qualified nonprofits and libraries.

Practical steps:
- Check donation programs (e.g., nonprofit-focused distributors) for available products and inventory first.
- If a product is out-of-stock or you need more copies, look for vendor nonprofit discounts or special programs.
- When using donation programs, follow any portal instructions (e.g., locating volume license keys).

---

## Server software licensing basics
Server products often require:
1. A license to install/run the server application itself (usually bundled).
2. Client licenses for users/devices that access the server (Client Access Licenses, or CALs), depending on product and licensing model.
3. In some cases, processor licenses or per-processor licensing for certain server editions.

Examples:
- Some server editions (e.g., certain Windows Server or SQL Server editions) require a license per processor for multi-CPU servers — no CALs required in those scenarios.
- Other server products require CALs for authenticated users/devices.

---

## Client Access Licenses (CALs): User vs Device
- User CAL: assigned to a person; allows that person to access all instances of a server product across the organisation from any device.
  - Best when employees use multiple devices.
- Device CAL: assigned to a device; allows any number of users to use that device to access the server.
  - Best when multiple users share a single device (e.g., shift workstations).

Choosing a CAL mode:
- Two licensing modes are commonly used for Windows Server families:
  - Per seat (default): CALs are assigned per seat (users or devices) across servers.
  - Per server: CALs are tied to a particular server and count simultaneous connections.
- You select the mode at installation/configuration of the server product. CALs themselves are not mode-specific.

Important note:
- CALs are not "installed" in the conventional sense; the server software typically does not enforce CAL counts except in per-server mode (which treats CALs as simultaneous connections).

---

## Special client licensing scenarios and exceptions

- Anonymous (unauthenticated) external users: typically do not need CALs (e.g., website visitors accessing IIS-hosted content anonymously).
- Authenticated external users (clients outside your organisation): options include:
  - Buying individual CALs for those external users (if few).
  - External Connector License (ECL): covers all authenticated external users, but usually much more expensive — cost-effective only with large numbers of external users.
  - Note: ECL covers external users only; internal employees/contractors still require CALs.
- Terminal Services / Remote Desktop Services (RDS): requires separate TS/RDS CALs in addition to Windows Server CALs for each user or device accessing Terminal Services.
- Management software (e.g., enterprise system center products): often uses Management Licenses (MLs) — e.g., desktops/workstations require client MLs; servers require server MLs (standard or enterprise).
- Enterprise CALs: some products have both Standard CALs and Enterprise CALs; advanced features often require both (additive licensing).
- Virtualisation: every installed instance of an application (physical or virtual) is an "instance"; licensing rules for how many instances a single license covers vary by product. Pay attention to virtualization licensing rules and available virtualization rights.

---

## Practical checklist before acquiring software
- Identify who will use the software (employees, volunteers, external clients) and whether users are authenticated.
- Determine whether access is by user or device and choose User CALs or Device CALs accordingly.
- Check whether server editions require per-processor licenses or use CAL-based licensing.
- If external authenticated users exist, estimate their numbers and compare buying CALs vs. acquiring an ECL.
- For virtualised environments, count the number of instances and verify vendor virtualization rights.
- Check nonprofit donation and discount programs and review inventory availability before purchasing retail.
- Confirm activation key & license key retrieval process (single org key vs. per-copy keys).
- Maintain an internal license inventory (product name, license type, quantity, purchase/donation date, activation keys, expiry/renewal info).
- Read product-specific licensing guides or vendor volume-licensing documentation for nuances.

---

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Underestimating authenticated access: forgetting to license authenticated external users or service accounts can create compliance gaps.
- Miscounting devices vs users: choose the wrong CAL type for your usage pattern and overspend.
- Ignoring server edition differences: some editions include different virtualization or processor licensing requirements.
- Assuming freeware = open source: freeware may be proprietary; verify redistribution and source access rights.
- Relying on assumptions about donation programs: always confirm stock levels and eligibility rules before planning deployment.
- Failing to track licenses centrally: create a simple spreadsheet or use a licence management tool to avoid over- or under-deployment.

---

## Quick glossary
- CAL: Client Access License — grants access rights to server software for a user or device.
- ECL: External Connector License — covers authenticated external users for a server product.
- EULA: End User License Agreement — the click-through agreement you accept to use software.
- ML: Management License — license used by certain enterprise management products.
- Copyleft: licensing approach that requires modified versions to be released under the same license.
- Freeware/Shareware: usually proprietary terms for free-to-obtain or trial software, respectively.

---

## Example: How licensing choices affect cost
- Small organisation with many mobile employees: User CALs are likely most cost-effective (single CAL per person).
- 24-hour call centre with shared workstations: Device CALs can reduce costs since multiple shifts share devices.
- Public-facing website with anonymous visitors: No CALs needed for anonymous access, but authenticated portal users may require CALs or an ECL.

---

## Resources and next steps
- Always read product-specific licensing documentation from the software vendor for exact terms.
- For organisations eligible for donations or discounts, consult nonprofit-focused distributors and donation portals to check available software and instructions for retrieving license keys.
- Maintain records of all licenses and periodically audit installations against entitlements.

---

By understanding license types, how server and client licensing models work, and following a practical acquisition checklist, organisations can make informed choices that meet their needs while staying compliant and optimising cost.

### Exams
Below are five different exam styles you can choose from. Each exam contains 15 tasks: 5 easy, 5 medium, and 5 hard. Every task includes a model answer/solution for grading. All questions are self-contained and based on the material your students have read.

Exam 1 — Mixed format (multiple-choice + short answers + true/false with justification)
- Easy: 5 multiple-choice questions (one best answer each).
- Medium: 5 short-answer questions (concise explanation).
- Hard: 5 true/false statements; students must mark T/F and give a short justification.

Answers follow each question.

Exam 1
Easy (choose one correct option)
1. Which term describes software that grants the user rights to copy, modify, and redistribute, regardless of price?
   A) Freeware
   B) Free software
   C) Shareware
   D) Proprietary software
   Solution: B) Free software — “free” refers to freedoms and permissions (copy, modify, redistribute); price is not asserted.

2. Which of the following is typically a “click-through” license you accept when installing consumer software?
   A) Volume license
   B) EULA
   C) External Connector License
   D) Public domain declaration
   Solution: B) EULA — click-through End User Licensing Agreement.

3. A copyleft license requires:
   A) Giving up all copyrights
   B) Releasing modifications under the same terms
   C) Charging for every redistribution
   D) Hiding source code
   Solution: B) Releasing modifications under the same terms — copyleft forces derivatives to use same license.

4. Device CALs are most appropriate when:
   A) Each employee has a personal device
   B) Servers are licensed per processor
   C) Multiple employees share the same workstation (e.g., shift work)
   D) External anonymous web users access IIS
   Solution: C) Multiple employees share the same workstation — Device CALs suit shared devices.

5. If you run Windows Server 2008 Datacenter on a two-processor server, you need:
   A) One license for the server regardless of processors
   B) A separate license per processor
   C) Only client access licenses (CALs)
   D) An ECL instead of CALs
   Solution: B) A separate license per processor — processor license required for multi-processor servers.

Medium (short answer — 1–3 sentences)
6. Briefly distinguish “freeware” from “free software.”
   Solution: Freeware is typically proprietary: free of charge but without source code or redistribution rights; free software grants freedom to view, modify, copy, and redistribute (price unrelated).

7. Name two practical benefits of volume licensing listed in the text.
   Solution: Lower cost when buying more; easier installation via single organisation-wide activation code; easier tracking of licenses via online accounts. (Any two of these.)

8. Explain the difference between a User CAL and a Device CAL.
   Solution: User CALs assign a license to a person, letting them access all server instances from any device; Device CALs assign a license to a device, allowing any user of that device to access server instances.

9. When would you consider buying an External Connector License (ECL) instead of User CALs?
   Solution: Only if you have a large number of authenticated external users, because ECL covers all authenticated external users but is much more expensive (admin fee example: ECL £76 vs User CAL £1).

10. Why do Terminal Services (TS) connections require an additional license beyond Windows Server CALs?
    Solution: Because TS requires its own TS CAL for each client (user or device) in addition to the Windows Server CAL—TS is a separate license requirement.

Hard (true/false + justification)
11. T/F: In per server mode Windows ties CALs to a particular server instance, and the 41st authenticated user will be denied if you have 40 CALs.
    Solution: True. Per server mode treats each license as a simultaneous connection to a particular instance; the 41st authenticated user will be denied (document example).

12. T/F: If a server application is licensed by processor, you still always need client CALs for internal users.
    Solution: False. Generally you don’t need client licenses for applications licensed by processor (the document says generally you don't need client licenses for applications licensed this way).

13. T/F: Releasing software into the public domain is an example of copyleft licensing.
    Solution: False. Public domain gives up copyright and is free software but is not copyleft (copyleft imposes the restriction to release modifications under same terms).

14. T/F: Anonymous web visitors to an IIS-hosted site require User CALs.
    Solution: False. You don't need client licenses for anonymous, unauthenticated external users.

15. T/F: With Exchange Server, a user may need both a Standard CAL and an Enterprise CAL to access advanced features.
    Solution: True. For some products (e.g., Exchange), CALs are additive; a user needs both Standard and Enterprise CALs for advanced features.

Exam 2 — Focused tasks (matching + gap-fill + calculation + ordering + short essay)
- Easy: 5 matching/gap-fill items.
- Medium: 5 small calculations/ordering/short procedures.
- Hard: 5 mini-essay or applied reasoning problems.

Answers directly under each task.

Exam 2
Easy (matching / fill-in)
1. Match the term to definition (write letter): Terms: A) ECL B) Copyleft C) Freeware D) Shareware E) Public domain
   Definitions:
   1) Trial software you use for limited time — Solution: D) Shareware
   2) License that forces derivatives to remain under same terms — Solution: B) Copyleft
   3) Software you can download without paying but typically cannot see source — Solution: C) Freeware
   4) Releases all rights; not copyleft — Solution: E) Public domain
   5) License covering all authenticated external users (often costly) — Solution: A) ECL

2. Fill-in: The click-through license commonly accepted during installation is called a __________.
   Solution: EULA.

3. Fill-in: A license that is issued per physical processor rather than per-user is called a __________ license.
   Solution: Processor license.

4. Fill-in: When many copies are bought, organisations often receive a single organisation-wide activation code; this is a benefit of __________ licensing.
   Solution: Volume licensing.

5. Fill-in: If multiple employees share one computer in shifts, the company will likely prefer __________ CALs.
   Solution: Device CALs.

Medium
6. Ordering: Place these actions in the order a small organisation might follow to acquire donated Microsoft licenses through TechSoup according to the text: A) Check TechSoup Stock, B) Go to eOpen to locate Volume keys, C) Search for “volume licensing not-for-profits software”, D) Check TechSoup donation program pages for specific vendor programs.
   Solution: A → D → C → B. (Check Stock first; then vendor-specific donation pages; if not available search broadly; if obtained go to eOpen for keys.)

7. Calculation: Your organisation has 120 employees who each use multiple devices. You run one Windows Server instance (not per-server mode). Which CAL scheme likely minimizes licenses, User CALs or Device CALs? State which and why. (No numeric answer required.)
   Solution: User CALs — because each employee uses multiple devices; a User CAL permits one user to access from many devices, so 120 User CALs < potentially many Device CALs.

8. Short procedure: List three things a nonprofit should check when deciding between User CALs and Device CALs.
   Solution: (1) Whether employees share devices (shift work); (2) how many devices each user uses; (3) cost comparisons and usage patterns (number of users vs number of devices), plus server count if using per-server mode.

9. Calculation/estimate: You have Windows Server in per-server mode with one server and 40 CALs. On a busy day, 60 authenticated users might try to connect simultaneously. What happens, and what are two remedies?
   Solution: The 41st–60th authenticated users will be denied access because only 40 simultaneous connections allowed. Remedies: buy more CALs for that server; switch to per-seat mode and manage CAL allocation differently; set up additional server instances with own CALs.

10. Ordering: Rank these in terms of increasing administrative fee cost based on the example numbers in the text: User CAL admin fee, ECL admin fee.
    Solution: User CAL admin fee (£1) < ECL admin fee (£76).

Hard
11. Mini-essay (3–5 sentences): Explain the licensing wrinkle that occurs with server-based software when distinguishing between “clients” as users vs “clients” as devices. Give one practical implication for procurement.
    Solution: The document explains that “client” can mean either end-users (employees, contractors) or computing devices (PCs, smartphones). Licensing models (User CAL vs Device CAL) depend on that distinction—if clients are users, User CALs fit; if clients are devices (shared devices), Device CALs fit. Practically, procurement must examine actual usage patterns (shift work, BYOD) before buying to avoid overbuying wrong type of CALs.

12. Case calculation: A charity runs SQL Server licensed by processor on a two-processor host. They have 30 internal users and 10 external authenticated users. According to the text, how many processor licenses and CALs are required for SQL Server in this scenario? Explain.
    Solution: For SQL Server licensed by processor, you need a processor license per processor (so 2 processor licenses) and generally you don’t need client licenses for processor-licensed applications. Therefore no CALs required for SQL Server. External users would not need CALs for SQL Server in this licensing mode. (Note: document states SQL Server 2008 works same way regarding processor licenses and generally you don't need client licenses for apps licensed by processor.)

13. Policy question: A nonprofit has many authenticated external users and limited admin budget. Using the example fee numbers, explain under what conditions it makes sense to buy an ECL rather than User CALs, and compute the break-even point in administrative fees if User CAL admin fee £1 and ECL admin fee £76.
    Solution: ECL is worth it only if external authenticated user count is large. Break-even: ECL admin fee (£76) equals admin fees for 76 User CALs at £1 each. So if you’d otherwise need more than ~76 User CALs for external users, ECL admin fee may be comparable; but ECL covers all authenticated external users in one fee while user CALs scale per-user. Consider total license costs beyond admin fee before deciding.

14. Applied reasoning: Why might per-server mode be attractive to a very small organisation with one or two servers and limited access requirements? Give two reasons drawn from text.
    Solution: Per-server mode ties licenses to simultaneous connections per server, which can be simpler if few servers exist (one set per server). If the organisation has a small, well-bounded user base and predictable simultaneous access below purchased CAL count, per-server can be simpler and cheaper because you buy just enough simultaneous connections per server rather than managing wide per-user entitlements.

15. Advanced matching: Identify three special additional licenses mentioned in the text that are required beyond basic Windows Server CALs and briefly state their purpose.
    Solution: (1) TS CAL — for Terminal Services access in addition to Windows Server CALs; (2) Server management licenses (ML) — for System Center products to manage desktops/servers; (3) Enterprise CAL (additive) — grants access to advanced product features and sometimes must be added to Standard CAL.

Exam 3 — Case-study heavy (practical decision-making)
- Easy: 5 quick scenario identifications.
- Medium: 5 mid-length scenarios requiring calculations and recommendations.
- Hard: 5 complex, multi-constraint licensing plans or policy memos.

Each case followed by an instructor solution.

Exam 3
Easy (identify the correct licensing term or immediate action)
1. A volunteer downloads a utility that’s free to use but the distributor doesn’t provide source code and forbids redistribution. What is this most likely called?
   Solution: Freeware (proprietary, free of charge but without source or redistribution rights).

2. You buy many copies of an office product and receive a single activation key for your organisation. What licensing approach is this?
   Solution: Volume licensing (organisation-wide activation code).

3. Your website on IIS is visited by thousands of anonymous readers daily. Do you need CALs for these anonymous users?
   Solution: No—anonymous, unauthenticated external users do not require CALs.

4. A small museum wants to reinstall Windows Server after hardware failure. Where might they find donation volume license keys (per the text)?
   Solution: The eOpen website (if obtained through TechSoup or similar distributors).

5. If a product requires both Standard CAL and Enterprise CAL for advanced features, what term describes this relationship?
   Solution: Additive licensing (both are required).

Medium (scenario + recommendation)
6. Scenario: A library has 50 staff (each with a laptop and a desktop) and 20 public-use terminals shared among patrons. They run multiple instances of Windows Server. Recommend whether to buy User CALs or Device CALs and justify numerically.
   Solution: Device CALs for public terminals (20) make sense because patrons share machines. For staff: User CALs may be better because each staff has two devices; 50 User CALs cover both devices per person. Combined approach: 50 User CALs + 20 Device CALs, or assess whether converting some public terminals to guest/anonymous access avoids CALs. Numerical justification: 50 users × 1 User CAL = 50 licenses vs 50 ×2 if Device CALs per device would be 100, so User CALs are cheaper for staff.

7. Scenario: An organisation runs Exchange Server and needs advanced features for 30 users. How many CALs are required if the product uses additive Standard + Enterprise CAL model?
   Solution: Each of the 30 users needs both a Standard CAL and an Enterprise CAL. So total = 30 Standard CALs + 30 Enterprise CALs.

8. Scenario: A nonprofit considers using SQL Server on a 4-processor machine and plans to license per processor. How many processor licenses are required? Would client CALs still be required for internal users?
   Solution: 4 processor licenses required (one per processor). Generally no client CALs are required when licensing by processor for that application.

9. Scenario: You have Windows Server set up in per-server mode on two servers; you purchased 40 CALs for server A and 40 CALs for server B. If 45 authenticated users try to access server A simultaneously, what happens? What if some users need to access both servers frequently?
   Solution: On server A the 45th authenticated user will be denied because only 40 simultaneous connections are allowed. If users need to access both servers, you'd need CALs appropriate per-server (additional sets) or switch to per-seat mode (User CALs assigned to users) to allow access across multiple servers without tying CALs to particular servers.

10. Calculation: The museum can get up to four Adobe products via TechSoup donation in a year. They need Creative Suite but TechSoup is out of stock. Suggest two alternative options mentioned in the text.
    Solution: Use TechSoup’s special Adobe donation program or check Adobe Solutions for Nonprofits for discounts (also search for other not-for-profit software discount options).

Hard (complex planning / policy memos)
11. Planning: Your organisation runs a physical server with 2 processors, hosts three instances of Windows Server (for different services), and also hosts several virtual machines. The organisation has 150 employees who each use multiple devices. Draft a concise licensing plan (what license types to buy and why), referencing constraints from the text.
    Solution: For the physical server with 2 processors, consider processor licensing for the server applications that allow it (requires two processor licenses). But for Windows Server instances, if using per-user access across multiple servers and multiple devices per user, User CALs are likely most cost-effective: purchase 150 User CALs so each employee can access all instances from any device. If per-server mode is used, you'd need separate CAL pools per server; that's less convenient with multiple instances. Also consider virtualization rules: verify how many instances each license covers (document warns instance rules vary). If Terminal Services will be used, buy TS CALs as well. If managing endpoints with System Center, add MLs for management. Finally, check TechSoup donation programs for discounted volume licensing for nonprofits.

12. Comparative memo: A nonprofit must decide between buying many User CALs or purchasing an ECL for authenticated external users (e.g., partner organisations). Provide the decision criteria and a sample numeric threshold based on admin fees in the text.
    Solution: Decision criteria: number of authenticated external users, total cost of ECL vs aggregated User CAL costs, administrative fee break-even (ECL £76 admin vs User CAL £1 admin), plus per-license purchase price beyond admin fees and whether ECL excludes internal user coverage (it does). Numeric threshold: admin-wise, if you need more than ~76 external User CALs, ECL admin fee equals admin fees of those CALs; but because ECL’s total cost is higher, evaluate total license costs. If external user count is very large and predictable, ECL may be efficient; for few external users, buy individual User CALs.

13. Compliance analysis: An auditor asks whether anonymous external web traffic to your IIS site requires CALs. Provide the canonical answer and a short explanation.
    Solution: No—anonymous, unauthenticated external users do not require CALs. CALs apply to authenticated users/devices accessing Windows-based services; anonymous visitors to a public website are not CAL-covered.

14. Design question: You must recommend a license-tracking approach for a multi-office nonprofit that gets volume licenses and has frequent staff turnover. Based on the text, list four specific measures/tools or practices to implement.
    Solution: (1) Use vendor-provided online account for volume licensing to track activations; (2) keep a centralized inventory of allocated User CALs and devices; (3) use organisation-wide activation keys to simplify reinstallations and store them securely; (4) review TechSoup accounts for donated licenses and eOpen for locating Volume license keys; implement processes for reclaiming CALs on staff exit and for periodic audits.

15. Complex scenario: Your organisation runs System Center Configuration Manager to manage 200 desktops. Which new licenses are required, and what are the distinctions for servers vs desktops according to the text?
    Solution: System Center products use management licenses (ML). Each desktop/workstation managed needs a client management license. Servers managed need a server management license (standard or enterprise); you need either standard or enterprise (not both). Therefore purchase 200 client MLs for desktops and appropriate server ML(s) for servers managed (standard or enterprise depending on features required). Also check special licensing for virtual instances if managing VMs.

Exam 4 — Analytical + synthesis (definitions, comparisons, diagram/flow)
- Easy: 5 concise definitions.
- Medium: 5 comparative analyses or mini-essays.
- Hard: 5 synthesis tasks including drawing or listing process flows (describe expected student diagram in words).

Each task followed by solution.

Exam 4
Easy (concise definitions — one sentence)
1. Define “copyleft.”
   Solution: A license that grants free software freedoms but requires that modifications and derivatives be released under the same terms as the original.

2. Define “EULA.”
   Solution: An End User Licensing Agreement: a click-through license users accept when installing software that sets the terms of use.

3. Define “User CAL.”
   Solution: A Client Access License assigned to a person, allowing that person to access instances of the server product from any device.

4. Define “Device CAL.”
   Solution: A Client Access License assigned to a device, allowing any user of that device to access server instances.

5. Define “volume licensing.”
   Solution: A licensing approach where buying multiple copies provides benefits like lower cost, single activation codes, and easier license tracking.

Medium (comparisons/explanations)
6. Compare “free software” and “open source” briefly and note any nuance mentioned in the text.
   Solution: The terms are used interchangeably in everyday speech; both grant similar practical freedoms, but official definitions and underlying philosophies differ. The text notes proponents largely agree but references reading for nuance.

7. Explain why freeware and shareware are “confusing” relative to free software.
   Solution: Because freeware/shareware concern price or trial terms rather than user freedoms; freeware may be free to obtain but proprietary (no source or redistribution rights), shareware is trialware, typically requiring payment after a period.

8. Explain per-seat mode vs per-server mode in Windows Server CAL usage.
   Solution: Per-seat (default) ties CALs to users or devices across servers (typical User/Device CAL model), while per-server mode ties CALs to simultaneous connections on a specific server instance — each server needs its own CAL pool and denies connections beyond the pool.

9. Describe one licensing complication introduced by virtualization.
   Solution: Virtualization creates multiple instances of operating systems on one physical server; licensing treats each installed instance as an “instance” and the number permitted per license varies by product, complicating license counts and requiring product-specific rules.

10. Explain the difference between a server management license and a client management license for System Center products.
    Solution: Client management licenses are required for each desktop/workstation managed by System Center; server management licenses are required for servers being managed, with two types for servers (standard and enterprise) and you need one or the other but not both.

Hard (synthesis / diagram description)
11. Task: Draw (or describe in words) a flowchart that an IT manager should follow to decide whether to purchase User CALs, Device CALs, per-processor licenses, or an ECL. Describe each decision node succinctly.
    Solution (description): Start: Identify application type (server app licensed per processor? If yes → buy processor licenses; stop). Else ask: Are users internal or external? If external authenticated and many → evaluate ECL cost vs User CALs (branch). Next ask: Are devices shared (shift work)? If yes → prefer Device CALs; if not and users use multiple devices → prefer User CALs. Then ask: Are you using per-server mode? If yes → determine simultaneous connection counts and buy per-server CAL pool for each server. End with check: need for additional TS CALs or management MLs? Add them if necessary.

12. Policy creation: Compose a 6–8 line internal policy paragraph that instructs staff how to handle software obtained via TechSoup donations (activation keys, checking stock, eOpen).
    Solution (model paragraph): Before acquiring donated software, staff must check TechSoup Stock for available products. If the needed product is unavailable, staff should consult TechSoup’s vendor-specific donation pages and search for volume licensing donation options. When a donation is approved, the IT lead must retrieve and securely store organisation-wide activation keys via the eOpen portal and record them in the central license inventory. All installations must be tracked in the online licence account and reassessed annually; do not redistribute activation keys outside authorised IT personnel.

13. Complex comparison: Provide three pros and three cons of per-server mode compared with per-seat (per-user) mode for an organisation with remote workers and multiple servers.
    Solution: Pros of per-server mode: simpler for very small setups; direct control by server instance; may be appropriate if simultaneous connections are predictable. Cons: requires separate license pools per server, denies users when limits hit, not flexible for remote workers who access multiple servers. Per-seat (User CAL) pros: flexible for remote workers and multi-server access; easier to manage per-person entitlements. Cons: may require many user licenses and initial assignment tracking; not optimal when many users share few devices.

14. Design exercise: Describe how you would document Terminal Services licensing for an audit (what to record and why).
    Solution: Record number of TS CALs purchased, whether they are User or Device TS CALs, assignment mapping to users or devices, dates of purchase, license keys, and evidence of installations using TS. Also include Windows Server CAL records because TS CALs are in addition to Windows Server CALs. This shows compliance and explains entitlements to auditors.

15. Advanced synthesis: The organisation runs legacy servers, a mix of virtual instances, and external partners needing occasional authenticated access. Give a prioritized 5-step action plan (brief bullets) to ensure licensing compliance with minimal immediate cost.
    Solution: (1) Audit current server instances (physical and virtual) and processors to identify applications licensed per-processor vs CAL-based. (2) Inventory active users/devices and frequency of external authenticated access. (3) Check TechSoup Stock and vendor donation programs for discounted volume licenses and eOpen for keys. (4) For internal staff who use multiple devices, buy User CALs; for shared machines buy Device CALs; for occasional external authenticated users buy a small number of User CALs rather than a costly ECL. (5) Purchase TS CALs if Terminal Services are used and management MLs if using System Center; document all licenses centrally and set review schedule.

Exam 5 — Applied problems + role-play + math (practical procurement)
- Easy: 5 direct short answers or small calculations.
- Medium: 5 procurement checklists, negotiation points, or short calculations.
- Hard: 5 multi-part problems including math, recommendation, and justification.

Solutions after each task.

Exam 5
Easy
1. True/False: Shareware typically allows indefinite unlimited use without payment.
   Solution: False — shareware is trial software; you usually must pay after a trial period.

2. Short: What website is specifically mentioned as a place to locate Microsoft Volume license keys when you obtained software through TechSoup?
   Solution: eOpen.

3. Short: Which license type covers authenticated external users but is usually more expensive than individual User CALs?
   Solution: External Connector License (ECL).

4. Small calc: If an organisation buys 100 User CALs with an admin fee of £1 each, what is the admin fee total (based on the example)?
   Solution: £100.

5. Small calc: Using the example admin fees, how many User CALs have equivalent admin-fee cost to one ECL at £76?
   Solution: 76 User CALs (76 × £1 = £76).

Medium
6. Procurement checklist (list five items): What five checks should IT perform before acquiring server-based software?
   Solution: (1) Check whether the software requires processor licenses or CALs; (2) Determine number of internal users/devices and external authenticated users; (3) Decide between User vs Device CALs based on usage; (4) Check TechSoup or vendor donation programs for discounts and eOpen for keys; (5) Identify additional license needs (TS CALs, management MLs, Enterprise CAL add-ons) and virtualization instance rules.

7. Negotiation point: You are negotiating a volume licensing deal and the vendor offers per-device CALs at lower unit price than per-user CALs. What operational questions should you ask to decide which to accept?
   Solution: Ask whether devices are shared by multiple users (shift work), how many devices each user uses, mobility/remote access patterns (BYOD), projected turnover, whether devices are centrally managed, and whether lower unit price offsets increased number of devices vs users.

8. Calculation: A nonprofit wants to cover 200 external authenticated users. Which is likely cheaper based solely on admin fees from the text — buying 200 User CALs at £1 admin each, or one ECL at £76 admin? Which is cheaper and by how much (admin fees only)?
   Solution: 200 User CALs admin fees = £200; one ECL admin = £76. ECL is cheaper by £124 in admin fees alone. (But total license cost not provided; must consider full price.)

9. Short: For System Center Configuration Manager, what license type is required for each desktop managed?
   Solution: Client management license (ML).

10. Short: Does the server software enforce CAL counts by refusing connections in per-seat mode?
    Solution: No — the server software generally cannot refuse access on licensing grounds except in per-server mode where simultaneous connections are enforced.

Hard
11. Multi-part licensing math: Your organisation runs:
    - One Windows Server (single instance) in per-server mode with 40 CALs purchased.
    - 120 employees, each using two devices.
    - 10 external authenticated users.
   a) If the organisation remains in per-server mode, what is the maximum number of authenticated internal users who can access the server simultaneously?
   b) If the organisation switches to per-seat (User CAL) mode and buys 120 User CALs, how does that change simultaneous access constraints across multiple devices?
   c) Which mode is likely better for the organisation and why?
   Solutions:
   a) In per-server mode with 40 CALs, only 40 authenticated users can access simultaneously—regardless of total employees.
   b) In per-seat mode with 120 User CALs, up to 120 distinct users can have access (each user can connect from multiple devices). There is no per-server simultaneous connections cap tied to a specific server instance in this mode (aside from normal resource constraints).
   c) Per-seat (User CAL) mode is likely better because each employee uses multiple devices; 120 User CALs allow broader access than the 40 simultaneous limit in per-server mode.

12. Complex scenario with virtualization: Your charity runs two hosts:
    - Host A: 2 physical processors, runs 4 virtual instances of Windows Server for different services.
    - Host B: 1 physical processor, runs 2 virtual instances.
   The vendor’s licensing rule (as in text) is: "Every installation creates an instance; the number of instances permitted per license varies by product." Given only the information in the text (no product-specific instance counts), what questions must you ask the vendor or check in product volume-licensing briefs before deciding on license purchases? Provide at least six specific items.
   Solution: Questions to ask/check: (1) Does the specific Windows Server edition permit multiple virtual instances on a single license and how many? (2) Are processor licenses required per physical processor or per core? (3) If licensing by processor, do processor licenses cover virtual instances on that host? (4) Are CALs still required for users/devices when virtual instances are used? (5) Are there special virtualization licensing terms for the server edition in use (e.g., Datacenter vs Standard)? (6) Are there management ML implications for VMs (System Center rules)? Also check whether measuring instances counts per physical host or per VM and whether any license mobility or virtualization rights apply.

13. Role-play negotiation: You are the IT manager of a small nonprofit with 35 authenticated external partner users and 110 internal users. Using the ECL/admin fee example and other text points, prepare a short argument (3–4 sentences) for acquiring individual User CALs for external partners rather than an ECL.
   Solution (model): Because the ECL has a high administrative fee and is intended mainly for very large external user counts, with only 35 external authenticated partners the ECL is unlikely to be cost-effective (admin-wise a single ECL equals 76 User CAL admin fees). Buying 35 external User CALs keeps costs proportional to actual usage, minimizes upfront expense, and avoids paying for a blanket connector license that still requires CALs for employees. Therefore purchase User CALs for external partners and monitor growth.

14. Combined licensing pitfalls: List five distinct mistakes an organisation might make when interpreting vendor licensing language (based on the nuances in the text), and give one-sentence advice to avoid each.
   Solution:
   - Mistake: Confusing “free” with “freeware” — Advice: Check rights to source, modify, and redistribute, not just price.
   - Mistake: Assuming processor licensing always eliminates CALs — Advice: Confirm product-specific rules; processor licensing often removes need for CALs but verify.
   - Mistake: Buying Device CALs when most staff use multiple devices — Advice: Analyse device-sharing patterns and count devices vs users before buying.
   - Mistake: Assuming anonymous website users require CALs — Advice: Remember anonymous unauthenticated users do not require CALs for IIS.
   - Mistake: Overlooking Terminal Services TS CALs — Advice: Check whether TS is used and plan for TS CALs in addition to Windows Server CALs.

15. Final case (recommendation + justification): A nonprofit wants to host a new internal web application on Windows Server for all staff (200 people, half often remote) and occasional authenticated external clients (~150). They have limited budget and want simplest administration. Provide a recommended licensing approach (concise list of license types and counts or options) and justify in 4–5 lines using principles from the text.
   Solution: Recommended approach: Purchase 200 User CALs for internal staff (one per person) so remote staff can access from multiple devices; purchase 150 User CALs for authenticated external clients if needed (or evaluate an ECL only if external authenticated users will exceed ~76 and full ECL pricing is competitive), ensure any Terminal Services usage has TS CALs for relevant users/devices, and check TechSoup donation programs for possible donated volume licenses and eOpen keys. Justification: User CALs suit many users who use multiple devices; ECL is more expensive and only makes sense at larger scales; TechSoup can reduce costs; TS and System Center MLs are additional requirements to verify.

### Active Reading
# Active-Reading Interleaved Version (English)

Below I simulate an active reader working through the document step by step: a short "Before Reading" prep, then the original text interleaved with annotations, margin thoughts, questions, brief pause-summaries, and finally "After Reading" reflection, review, and application ideas.

---

## BEFORE READING

Preview (skim):  
- Headings / structure spotted: introduction about CTComms, overview of software licenses, Free vs Proprietary, Free/Open Source distinctions, copyleft/public domain, shareware/freeware, EULAs, volume licensing, client/server licensing (CALs, Device vs User), special licensing cases (ECL, TS, System Center, virtualization), author bio, copyright.  
- Repeated vendor focus: Microsoft examples, TechSoup resources.

Set a purpose (why I'm reading):  
- Understand basics of software licensing and practical licensing options for not-for-profits, especially Microsoft server/client licensing and volume licensing tips.

Activate prior knowledge:  
- I know that "free" can mean freedom (FSF) or free of price (freeware). Microsoft uses CALs; virtualization complicates licensing; EULAs often ignored; nonprofits can get donations/discounts via TechSoup.

---

## DURING READING (document text followed by active annotations)

CTComms sends on average 2 million emails monthly on behalf of over 125 different charities and not for profits.

> Annotation — Key data point: CTComms scale = 2M emails/month; serves 125+ charities.  
> Thoughts: This sets context for why licensing and reliable software matter for charities (high volume, many orgs).  
> Question: Is CTComms the article publisher or an example? (Probably context/author source.)

Take the complexity of technology and stir in the complexity of the legal system and what do you get? Software licenses! If you've ever attempted to read one you know how true this is, but you have to know a little about software licensing even if you can't parse all of the fine print.

> Annotation — Main idea: Software licenses are intersection of tech + law and are complex.  
> Thoughts: Yep — I often skip EULAs; but some terms (e.g., server CALs) have major org impacts.  
> Pause & summary: Expect overview of essentials to help non-experts.

A software license is an agreement between you and the owner of a program which lets you perform certain activities which would otherwise constitute an infringement under copyright law. The software license usually answers questions such as:

> Annotation — Definition: license = permission contract to avoid copyright infringement.  
> Question: The sentence ends with "answers questions such as:" — but the list seems missing here; check next lines for examples.

The price of the software and the licensing fees, if any, are sometimes discussed in the licensing agreement, but usually it's described elsewhere.

> Annotation — Note: Price may be in license but often separate.  
> Thought: Administrative details (prices, fees) often in purchase docs not license text.

If you read the definitions below and you're still scratching your head, check out Categories of Free and Non-Free Software which includes a helpful diagram.

> Annotation — Resource suggestion: "Categories of Free and Non-Free Software" for diagram.  
> Action: Flag to check linked resource if I need visual clarification.

Free vs Proprietary:  
When you hear the phrase "free software" or "free software license," "free" is referring to your rights and permissions ("free as in freedom" or "free as in free speech"). In other words, a free software license gives you more rights than a proprietary license. You can usually copy, modify, and redistribute free software without paying a fee or obtaining permission from the developers and distributors. In most cases "free software" won't cost you anything, but that's not always the case – in this instance the word free is making no assertion whatsoever about the price of the software. Proprietary software puts more restrictions and limits on your legal permission to copy, modify, and distribute the program.

> Annotation — Key distinction: "Free" = freedom (rights), not necessarily price. Proprietary = restricted rights.  
> Underline mentally: copy, modify, redistribute = core freedoms of free software.  
> Thought: Important to remember when evaluating license text — price ≠ freedom.

Free, Open-Source or FOSS?  
In everyday conversation, there's not much difference between "free software," "open source software," and "FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software)." In other words, you'll hear these terms used interchangeably, and the proponents of free software and the supporters of open-source software agree with one another on most issues. However, the official definition of free software differs somewhat from the official definition of open-source software, and the philosophies underlying those definitions differ as well. For a short description of the difference, read Live and Let License. For a longer discussion from the "free software" side, read Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software. For the "open-source" perspective, read Why Free Software is Too Ambiguous.

> Annotation — Note: Terms often used interchangeably but have philosophical differences. Useful links recommended.  
> Question: Do I need to read those essays now? Probably not unless I care about ideology; practical differences are limited for nonprofit procurement.

Public domain and copyleft.  
These terms refer to different categories of free, unrestricted licensing. A copyleft license allows you all the freedoms of a free software license, but adds one restriction. Under a copyleft license, you have to release any modifications under the same terms as the original software. In effect, this blocks companies and developers who want to alter free software and then make their altered version proprietary. In practice, almost all free and open-source software is also copylefted. However, technically you can release "free software" that isn't copylefted. For example, if you developed software and released it under a "public domain" license, it would qualify as free software, but it isn't copyleft. In effect, when you release something into the public domain, you give up all copyrights and rights of ownership.

> Annotation — Definitions:  
> - Copyleft = must distribute modifications under same license (reciprocity).  
> - Public domain = no copyright, no copyleft.  
> Thought: Copyleft prevents closed forks; public domain allows proprietary forks. Useful when choosing license for projects.

Shareware and freeware.  
These terms don't really refer to licensing, and they're confusing in light of the discussion of free software above. Freeware refers to software (usually small utilities at sites such as Tucows.com) that you can download and install without paying. However, you don't have the right to view the source code, and you may not have the right to copy and redistribute the software. In other words, freeware is proprietary software. Shareware is even more restrictive. In effect, shareware is trial software. You can use it for a limited amount of time (usually 30 or 60 days) and then you're expected to pay to continue using it.

> Annotation — Important practical note: freeware = free to use (often proprietary); shareware = trial.  
> Thought: Distinguish these from "free software" (freedom). Good to clarify to stakeholders who might think "free" equals OSS.

End User Licensing Agreement (EULA).  
When you acquire software yourself, directly from a vendor or retailer, or directly from the vendor's Web site, you usually have to indicate by clicking a box that you accept the licensing terms. This "click-through" agreement that no one ever reads is commonly known as a EULA. If you negotiate a large purchase of software with a company, and you sign a contract to seal the agreement, that contract usually replaces or supersedes the EULA.

> Annotation — EULA = click-through contract; individual retail EULA can be superseded by negotiated contract for large purchases.  
> Question: For nonprofits buying donated licenses, does the donation agreement override EULA? Likely vendor terms still bind.

Most major vendors of proprietary software offer some type of bulk purchasing and volume licensing mechanism. The terms vary widely, but if you order enough software to qualify, the benefits in terms of cost and convenience are significant. Also, not-for-profits sometimes qualify for it with very small initial purchases.

> Annotation — Volume licensing = cost & admin benefits; nonprofits may qualify.  
> Action: Flag volume licensing as a key area for cost savings for charities.

Some of the benefits of volume licensing include:  
- Lower cost. As with most products, software costs less when you buy more of it.  
- Ease of installation. Without volume licenses, you usually have to enter a separate activation code (also known as a product key or license key) for each installed copy of the program. On the other hand, volume licenses provide you with a single, organisation-wide activation code, which makes it much easier to find when you need to reinstall the software.  
- Easier tracking of licenses. Keeping track of how many licenses you own, and how many copies you've actually installed, is a tedious, difficult task. Many volume licensing programs provide an online account which is automatically updated when you obtain or activate a copy of that company's software. These accounts can also coordinate licensing across multiple offices within your organisation.

> Annotation — Bullet summary of benefits: cost, activation simplicity, license tracking.  
> Thought: For an org running many machines, switching to volume licensing could reduce admin time.

To learn more about volume licensing from a particular vendor, check out some of the resources below:  
Qualified not-for-profits and libraries can receive donated volume licenses for Microsoft products through TechSoup. For more information, check out our introduction to the Microsoft Software Donation Program, and the Microsoft Software Donation Program FAQ. For general information about the volume licensing of Microsoft software, see Volume Licensing Overview.

> Annotation — Resource highlight: TechSoup for nonprofits; Microsoft volume licensing docs.  
> Action: If I'm in a nonprofit, visit TechSoup first.

If you get Microsoft software from TechSoup or other software distributors who work with not-for-profits, you may need to go to the eOpen Web site to locate your Volume license keys. For more information, check out the TechSoup Donation Recipient's Guide to the Microsoft eOpen Web Site.

> Annotation — Practical step: Use eOpen site to find volume license keys; TechSoup guide available.  
> Thought: Keep login/credentials for these portals secure and documented.

Always check TechSoup Stock first to see if there's a volume licensing donation program for the software you're interested in. If TechSoup doesn't offer that product or if you need more copies than you can find at TechSoup, search for "volume licensing not-for-profits software" or just "not-for-profits software." For example, when we have an inventory of Adobe products, qualifying and eligible not-for-profits can obtain four individual products or one copy of Creative Suite 4 through TechSoup. If we're out of stock, or you've used up your annual Adobe donation, you can also check TechSoup's special Adobe donation program and also Adobe Solutions for Nonprofits for other discounts available to not-for-profits. For more software-hunting tips, see A Quick Guide to Discounted Software Programs.

> Annotation — Tip: Check TechSoup Stock and alternative vendor nonprofit programs (Adobe, etc.) — stock may be limited.  
> Action: Create a checklist for nonprofit software procurement: 1) TechSoup Stock, 2) vendor nonprofit programs, 3) search web.

Pay close attention to the options and licensing requirements when you acquire server-based software. You might need two different types of license – one for the server software itself, and a set of licenses for all the "clients" accessing the software. Depending on the vendor and the licensing scenario, "client" can refer either to the end users themselves (for example, employees, contractors, clients, and anyone else who uses the software in question) or their computing devices (for example, laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, PDAs, etc.). We'll focus on Microsoft server products, but similar issues can arise with other server applications.

> Annotation — Core warning: server apps often require server license + client licenses (users or devices).  
> Thought: This is where cost surprises often happen; count users/devices carefully.

Over the years, Microsoft has released hundreds of server-based applications, and the licensing terms are slightly different for each one. Fortunately, there are common license types and licensing structures across different products. In other words, while a User CAL (Client Access License) for Windows Server is distinct from a User CAL for SharePoint Server, the underlying terms and rights are very similar. The TechSoup product pages for Microsoft software do a good job of describing the differences between products, so we'll focus on the common threads in this article.

> Annotation — Note: CAL types similar across products; TechSoup pages helpful for product differences.  
> Action: If uncertain, read TechSoup product pages for specifics.

Moreover, Microsoft often lets you license a single server application in more than one way, depending on the needs of your organisation. This allows you the flexibility to choose the licenses that best reflect your organisation's usage patterns and thereby cost you the least amount of money. For example, for Windows Server and other products you can acquire licenses on a per-user basis (for example, User CALs) or per-device basis (for example, Device CALs).

> Annotation — Key choice: User CALs vs Device CALs — choose to match usage patterns to save cost.  
> Pause & summary: Assess whether your org has many users on few devices (Device CALs) or many devices per user (User CALs).

The license required to install and run most server applications usually comes bundled with the software itself. So you can install and run most applications "out of the box," as long as you have the right number of client licenses (see the section below for more on that). However, when you're running certain server products on a computer with multiple processors, you may need to get additional licenses. For example, if you run Windows Server 2008 DataCenter edition on a server with two processors, you need a separate license for each processor. SQL Server 2008 works the same way. This type of license is referred to as a processor license. Generally you don't need client licenses for any application that's licensed this way.

> Annotation — Processor licensing: some editions require licensing per CPU rather than CALs; client licenses often not required in that model.  
> Question: Consider VM/virtual cores — how are processors counted? Author later mentions virtualization — flag for reading.

Client Licenses for Internal Users  
Many Microsoft products, including Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, require client access licenses for all authenticated internal users (for example, employees, contractors, volunteers, etc.). On the other hand, SQL Server 2008 and other products don't require any client licenses. Read the product description at CTXchange if you're looking for the details about licensing a particular application.

> Annotation — Core rule: Authenticated internal users generally need CALs for some products; others don't. Check CTXchange for details.  
> Action: Generate a user list (employees/contractors/volunteers) to estimate CAL needs.

User CALs: User CALs allow each user access to all the instances of a particular server product in an organisation, no matter which device they use to gain access. In other words, if you run five copies of Windows Server 2008 on five separate servers, you only need one User CAL for each person in your organisation who access those servers (or any software installed on those servers), whether they access a single server, all five servers, or some number in between. Each user with a single CAL assigned to them can access the server software from as many devices as they want (for example, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, etc.). User CALs are a popular licensing option.

> Annotation — User CALs = license per person; good when users use many devices.  
> Reflection: For modern workplaces with BYOD and mobile access, User CALs often make sense.

Device CALs: Device CALs allow access to all instances of a particular server application from a single device (for example, a desktop computer, a laptop, etc.) in your organisation. Device CALs only make sense when multiple employees use the same computer. For example, in 24-hour call centres different employees on different shifts often use the same machine, so Device CALs make sense in this situation.

> Annotation — Device CALs = license per device; good for shared devices/shift work.  
> Action: For call centers or public kiosks, prefer Device CALs.

Choosing a licensing mode for your Windows Server CALs: With Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, you use a CAL (either a User CAL or a Device CAL) in one of two licensing modes: per seat or per server. You make this decision when you're installing your Windows Server products, not when you acquire the CALs. The CALs themselves don't have any mode designation, so you can use either a User CAL or a Device CAL in either mode. Per seat mode is the default mode, and the one used most frequently. The description of User CALs and Device CALs above describes the typical per seat mode. In "per server" mode, Windows treats each license as a "simultaneous connection." In other words, if you have 40 CALs, Windows will let 40 authenticated users have access. The 41st user will be denied access. However, in per server mode, each CAL is tied to a particular instance of Windows Server, and you have to acquire a new set of licenses for each new server you build that runs Windows. Therefore, per server mode works for some small organisations with one or two servers and limited access requirements.

> Annotation — Two modes: per seat (default) vs per server (simultaneous connections, server-tied).  
> Thought: Per server mode useful for small orgs with few servers; per seat better for flexibility across multiple servers.

You don't "install" client licenses the way you install software. There are ways to automate the tracking of software licenses indirectly, but the server software can't refuse access to a user or device on licensing grounds. The licenses don't leave any "digital footprint" that the server software can read. An exception to this occurs when you license Windows Server in per server mode. In this case, if you have 50 licenses, the 51st authenticated user will be denied access (though anonymous users can still access services).

> Annotation — Important: CALs are an entitlement/contract, not enforced by software (except per-server mode). Keep accurate records.  
> Action: Implement license inventory and audit trail (spreadsheet or license management tool).

Some key points to remember about client licensing:

> Annotation — Looks like summary bullets follow — I'll pay attention for exceptions.

The licensing scenarios described in this section arise less frequently, and are too complex to cover completely in this article, so they're described briefly below along with more comprehensive resources.

> Annotation — Author indicates complexity and points to external deeper resources. Good to consult vendor docs for special cases.

You don't need client licenses for anonymous, unauthenticated external users. In other words, if someone accesses your Web site, and that site runs on Internet Information Server (IIS), Microsoft's Web serving software, you don't need a client license for any of those anonymous users.

> Annotation — Rule: Anonymous web visitors do NOT require CALs.  
> Thought: That prevents paying per website visitor — good to know.

If you have any authenticated external users who access services on your Windows-based servers, you can obtain CALs to cover their licensing requirements. However, the External Connector License (ECL) is a second option in this scenario. The ECL covers all use by authenticated external users, but it's a lot more expensive than a CAL, so only get one if you'll have a lot of external users. For example, even if you get your licenses through the CTXchange donation program, an ECL for Windows Server 2008 has an £76 administrative fee, while a User CAL for Windows Server 2008 carries a £1 admin fee. If only a handful of external users access your Windows servers, you're better off acquiring User CALs. Also, an ECL only applies to external users and devices. In other words, if you have an ECL, you still have to get a CAL for all employees and contractors.

> Annotation — ECL = covers all authenticated external users (expensive); compare cost vs buying User CALs individually.  
> Action: Estimate number of authenticated external users before choosing ECL.

Even though Terminal Services (TS) is built into Windows Server 2003 and 2008, you need to get a separate TS CAL for each client (i.e. each user or each device) that will access Terminal Services in your organisation. This TS license is in addition to your Windows Server CALs.

> Annotation — TS CALs are extra on top of Windows CALs — dual licensing required.  
> Action: If using Remote Desktop/Terminal Services, add TS CALs to budget.

Microsoft's System Centre products (a line of enterprise-level administrative software packages) use a special type of license known as a management license (ML). Applications that use this type of licensing include System Center Configuration Manager 2007 and System Center Operations Manager 2007. Any desktop or workstation managed by one of these applications needs a client management license. Any server managed by one of these applications requires a server management license, and there are two types of server management licenses – standard and enterprise. You need one or the other but not both. There are also special licensing requirements if you're managing virtual instances of Windows operating systems. For more information, see TechSoup's Guide to System Center Products and Licensing and Microsoft's white paper on Systems Center licensing.

> Annotation — System Center uses MLs (client & server); standard vs enterprise server MLs (choose one). Virtualization imposes special rules.  
> Action: If deploying System Center, consult vendor licensing whitepaper and TechSoup guide.

Some Microsoft server products have two client licensing modes, standard and enterprise. As you might imagine, an Enterprise CAL grants access to more advanced features of a product. Furthermore, with some products, such as Microsoft Exchange, the licenses are additive. In other words, a user needs both a Standard CAL AND an Enterprise CAL in order to access the advanced features. See Exchange Server 2007 Editions and Client Access Licenses for more information.

> Annotation — Note: Some CALs are additive (Standard + Enterprise). Check product-specific rules (Exchange example).  
> Thought: Additive licensing increases cost — verify needed features before buying.

With virtualisation technologies, multiple operating systems can run simultaneously on a single physical server. Every time you install a Microsoft application, whether on a physical hardware system or a virtual hardware system, you create an "instance" of that application. The number of "instances" of particular application that you can run using a single license varies from product to product. For more information see the Volume Licensing Briefs, Microsoft Licensing for Virtualization and the Windows Server Virtualization Calculator. For TechSoup Stock products, see the product description for more information.

> Annotation — Virtualization: count instances per license rules; varies by product. Use Microsoft calculators/docs.  
> Action: Use Windows Server Virtualization Calculator to model costs for VMs.

There are a lot of nuances to Microsoft licensing, and also a lot of excellent resources to help you understand different scenarios.

> Annotation — Final note of caution: consult detailed resources for complex scenarios.

## AFTER READING

Summarize main ideas (brief, from memory):  
- Software licenses define legal permissions; "free" refers to rights, not price.  
- Distinctions: free software vs open source vs proprietary; copyleft vs public domain; freeware/shareware are often proprietary.  
- EULAs are common; enterprise purchases use negotiated contracts.  
- Volume licensing (esp. Microsoft) offers cost/admin benefits for nonprofits; TechSoup is a key resource.  
- Server software often requires both server license and client access licenses (CALs); choose User vs Device CALs to match usage.  
- Special cases: processor licenses, External Connector Licenses (ECL), Terminal Services CALs, System Center management licenses, virtualization instance rules, additive CALs (Standard + Enterprise).  
- Always consult vendor-specific documentation; licensing is nuanced.

Review your annotations (quick checklist extracted):  
- Check TechSoup Stock and vendor nonprofit programs first.  
- Count authenticated internal users and shared devices to choose User vs Device CALs.  
- Consider virtualization instance counts and processor-based licensing.  
- Beware additive CALs and extra TS CALs for Terminal Services.  
- Use vendor calculators/guides for complex scenarios.

Make connections to other knowledge / experience:  
- This matches my prior understanding that "free" is ambiguous and that Microsoft licensing is complex and can cause budget surprises. Volume licensing and donation programs are crucial for nonprofits. Virtualization adds licensing complexity I've seen in server consolidation projects.

Generate remaining questions (things I'm still wondering / would ask the author or vendor):  
- How does Microsoft now count cores/processors for licensing in modern (post-2009) editions? (Licensing has changed over time.)  
- For small nonprofits with hybrid cloud/on-prem setups, what is the most cost-effective mix of licenses?  
- How are subscription models (Office 365 / Microsoft 365) compared with on-prem CALs/donations? (Not covered — article predates cloud shifts.)  
- For donated licenses via TechSoup, what are ongoing support/upgrade limitations?

Reflect on application — How I might use this:  
- If advising a nonprofit, create a licensing checklist: inventory users/devices, identify server apps that need CALs, evaluate TechSoup options, model costs for User vs Device vs processor-based licensing, and check for additive CALs/TS/ML needs.  
- Keep documentation of donated volume license keys and TechSoup/eOpen credentials.  
- Schedule a license audit before major purchases or virtualization projects.

Final quick action items (practical next steps):  
- Inventory: list all authenticated users and shared devices.  
- Visit TechSoup and CTXchange product pages relevant to current software needs.  
- If planning virtualization, run vendor virtualization license calculator and consult vendor whitepapers.  
- If Terminal Services or System Center are in play, budget for additional CALs/MLs.

If you'd like, I can:
- Produce a one-page nonprofit licensing checklist based on this article.  
- Convert the key licensing choices (User vs Device, per-seat vs per-server, processor vs CAL) into a decision flowchart you can use when buying/licensing software.

Hold the salt: UCLA engineers develop revolutionary new desalination membrane
Process uses atmospheric pressure plasma to create filtering 'brush layer'
Desalination can become more economical and used as a viable alternate water resource.
By Wileen Wong Kromhout
Originally published in UCLA Newsroom
Researchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have unveiled a new class of reverse-osmosis membranes for desalination that resist the clogging which typically occurs when seawater, brackish water and waste water are purified.
The highly permeable, surface-structured membrane can easily be incorporated into today's commercial production system, the researchers say, and could help to significantly reduce desalination operating costs. Their findings appear in the current issue of the Journal of Materials Chemistry.
Reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination uses high pressure to force polluted water through the pores of a membrane. While water molecules pass through the pores, mineral salt ions, bacteria and other impurities cannot. Over time, these particles build up on the membrane's surface, leading to clogging and membrane damage. This scaling and fouling places higher energy demands on the pumping system and necessitates costly cleanup and membrane replacement.
The new UCLA membrane's novel surface topography and chemistry allow it to avoid such drawbacks.
"Besides possessing high water permeability, the new membrane also shows high rejection characteristics and long-term stability," said Nancy H. Lin, a UCLA Engineering senior researcher and the study's lead author. "Structuring the membrane surface does not require a long reaction time, high reaction temperature or the use of a vacuum chamber. The anti-scaling property, which can increase membrane life and decrease operational costs, is superior to existing commercial membranes."
The new membrane was synthesized through a three-step process. First, researchers synthesized a polyamide thin-film composite membrane using conventional interfacial polymerization. Next, they activated the polyamide surface with atmospheric pressure plasma to create active sites on the surface. Finally, these active sites were used to initiate a graft polymerization reaction with a monomer solution to create a polymer "brush layer" on the polyamide surface. This graft polymerization is carried out for a specific period of time at a specific temperature in order to control the brush layer thickness and topography.
"In the early years, surface plasma treatment could only be accomplished in a vacuum chamber," said Yoram Cohen, UCLA professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and a corresponding author of the study. "It wasn't practical for large-scale commercialization because thousands of meters of membranes could not be synthesized in a vacuum chamber. It's too costly. But now, with the advent of atmospheric pressure plasma, we don't even need to initiate the reaction chemically. It's as simple as brushing the surface with plasma, and it can be done for almost any surface."
In this new membrane, the polymer chains of the tethered brush layer are in constant motion. The chains are chemically anchored to the surface and are thus more thermally stable, relative to physically coated polymer films. Water flow also adds to the brush layer's movement, making it extremely difficult for bacteria and other colloidal matter to anchor to the surface of the membrane.
"If you've ever snorkeled, you'll know that sea kelp move back and forth with the current or water flow," Cohen said. "So imagine that you have this varied structure with continuous movement. Protein or bacteria need to be able to anchor to multiple spots on the membrane to attach themselves to the surface — a task which is extremely difficult to attain due to the constant motion of the brush layer. The polymer chains protect and screen the membrane surface underneath."
Another factor in preventing adhesion is the surface charge of the membrane. Cohen's team is able to choose the chemistry of the brush layer to impart the desired surface charge, enabling the membrane to repel molecules of an opposite charge.
The team's next step is to expand the membrane synthesis into a much larger, continuous process and to optimize the new membrane's performance for different water sources.
"We want to be able to narrow down and create a membrane selection system for different water sources that have different fouling tendencies," Lin said. "With such knowledge, one can optimize the membrane surface properties with different polymer brush layers to delay or prevent the onset of membrane fouling and scaling.
"The cost of desalination will therefore decrease when we reduce the cost of chemicals [used for membrane cleaning], as well as process operation [for membrane replacement]. Desalination can become more economical and used as a viable alternate water resource."
Cohen's team, in collaboration with the UCLA Water Technology Research (WaTeR) Center, is currently carrying out specific studies to test the performance of the new membrane's fouling properties under field conditions.
"We work directly with industry and water agencies on everything that we're doing here in water technology," Cohen said. "The reason for this is simple: If we are to accelerate the transfer of knowledge technology from the university to the real world, where those solutions are needed, we have to make sure we address the real issues. This also provides our students with a tremendous opportunity to work with industry, government and local agencies."
A paper providing a preliminary introduction to the new membrane also appeared in the Journal of Membrane Science last month.

### Summary
Researchers at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have developed a new class of reverse‑osmosis (RO) desalination membranes designed to resist the common problems of scaling and fouling that degrade performance, increase energy consumption, and drive frequent chemical cleaning and membrane replacement. The membranes combine a conventional thin‑film polyamide RO base with a surface‑tethered polymer “brush” layer created by an atmospheric‑pressure plasma activation and subsequent graft polymerization, yielding a high‑permeability, high‑rejection, thermally stable, and long‑lived membrane surface that is compatible with existing commercial production systems.

Problem addressed
- RO desalination forces water through membrane pores under high pressure while rejecting salts, bacteria, colloids and other impurities. Over time, rejected species accumulate on the membrane surface as scale and foulants, reducing permeability and increasing pumping energy and maintenance costs.
- Conventional surface coatings or treatments can be thermally unstable, require vacuum processing, long reaction times, or be impractical for large‑scale continuous membrane production.

Membrane architecture and fabrication process
- Base layer: A standard polyamide thin‑film composite membrane is formed via interfacial polymerization — the same approach used for current commercial RO membranes.
- Surface activation: The polyamide surface is treated with atmospheric‑pressure plasma to generate reactive active sites. Unlike older plasma treatments that required vacuum chambers (impractical for long membrane rolls), atmospheric plasma can be applied continuously and economically — effectively “brushing” the surface with reactive species without costly vacuum equipment.
- Brush formation: Those active sites initiate graft polymerization from a monomer solution to grow a tethered polymer brush layer. Controlling reaction time and temperature during graft polymerization tunes the brush thickness and surface topography.
- Result: A chemically anchored (grafted) polymer brush whose chains are permanently attached to the membrane surface rather than a physically deposited film.

Mechanisms of anti‑fouling and anti‑scaling performance
- Dynamic surface motion: The tethered polymer chains are in constant Brownian/water‑flow‑induced motion. This dynamic, brush‑like topography prevents bacteria, proteins, and colloids from establishing the multiple contact points required for stable adhesion. The researchers liken the motion to kelp swaying in a current: continuous movement and structural heterogeneity hinder attachment.
- Thermal and mechanical stability: Because the polymer is grafted to the surface, it is more thermally and mechanically stable than conventional physically coated polymers that can delaminate or degrade.
- Charge tuning: The brush chemistry can be selected to impart a specific surface charge, enabling electrostatic repulsion of oppositely charged foulants (for example, repelling anionic species by creating a negatively charged surface).
- Combined effect: The topographical motion plus electrostatic repulsion and a physically screened underlying polyamide surface reduce the likelihood of fouling and scaling, prolonging membrane life and maintaining permeability and salt rejection over longer operating intervals.

Performance and advantages
- The new membrane exhibits high water permeability and strong solute rejection, along with improved long‑term stability.
- Its anti‑scaling and anti‑fouling behavior outperforms current commercial membranes in laboratory testing, potentially cutting the frequency and cost of chemical cleaning and membrane replacement.
- Atmospheric‑pressure plasma enables practical large‑scale production since it removes the need for vacuum chambers and lengthy or high‑temperature reactions, making retrofitting or incorporation into existing manufacturing lines feasible.
- Operational benefits include lower energy demand (by preserving permeability and reducing required pump pressure), lower chemical use for cleaning, reduced downtime, and lower total cost of ownership for desalination plants.

Next steps and deployment pathway
- Scale‑up: The team aims to translate the batch/laboratory synthesis into a continuous, large‑area production process suitable for thousands of meters of membrane.
- Optimization: They plan to develop a membrane selection and optimization system tailored to different feedwater sources (seawater, brackish water, waste water) that display distinct fouling and scaling tendencies. By matching brush chemistries and topographies to specific feedwater challenges, membranes can be customized to delay or prevent fouling onset.
- Field testing: Collaborative studies with the UCLA Water Technology Research (WaTeR) Center and with industry and water agencies are underway to evaluate fouling performance under field conditions and address real‑world operational issues.
- Technology transfer and training: The research program emphasizes working closely with industry and agencies to accelerate adoption and to provide students with hands‑on experience in applied water technology development.

Publication and research team
- The findings are reported in the Journal of Materials Chemistry, with a preliminary introduction published in the Journal of Membrane Science. Key contributors include senior researcher Nancy H. Lin (lead author) and Professor Yoram Cohen (corresponding author).
- The work is positioned to bridge university research and practical implementation through partnerships with industry and water management organizations.

Implications
- By reducing fouling and scaling and enabling more economical, scalable manufacturing, these polymer‑brush‑modified RO membranes have the potential to lower the operating and maintenance costs of desalination systems.
- Reduced chemical cleaning, longer membrane lifetimes, and preserved permeability could make desalination more cost‑effective and more attractive as an alternative or supplementary water resource for regions facing freshwater scarcity.

### Q&A

### Educational Material
# Desalination membranes with anti-fouling polymer brush surfaces

## Learning objectives
- Understand how reverse osmosis (RO) desalination works and why membrane fouling and scaling are major problems.
- Learn about a surface-modification strategy that uses polymer “brush” layers to reduce fouling.
- Learn the main synthesis steps: interfacial polymerization, atmospheric-pressure plasma activation, and graft polymerization.
- Understand the physical and chemical mechanisms by which tethered polymer brushes reduce adhesion of salts, biofilms and colloids.
- Consider practical advantages, scale-up issues, and directions for optimizing membranes for different water sources.

---

## 1. Overview: reverse osmosis and its limitations
- Reverse osmosis (RO) desalination forces water through a semipermeable membrane under pressure. Water molecules pass; salts, colloids, bacteria and other impurities are retained.
- Over time, retained material accumulates on the membrane surface — a process called fouling (biofouling, organic fouling, particulate fouling) and scaling (inorganic salt deposition).
- Fouling and scaling reduce water flux, increase energy consumption (higher pressure needed), require frequent chemical cleaning and membrane replacement, and thus raise operating costs.

---

## 2. Strategies to reduce fouling
Common approaches:
- Pretreatment of feed water (filtration, chemical dosing).
- Periodic chemical cleaning.
- Membrane surface engineering: altering surface chemistry and topography to make adhesion more difficult.
- Coatings or grafted layers that impart hydrophilicity, charge repulsion or steric hindrance.

Limitations of simple coatings:
- Physically coated films can delaminate or wash away.
- Coatings may reduce permeability if they block pores.
- Vacuum-based surface treatments are not practical for long membrane rolls used in industry.

---

## 3. Polymer brush surface modification: concept
- A polymer “brush” is a dense layer of polymer chains chemically tethered at one end to a surface.
- Because the chains are anchored, they are more stable than physically adsorbed coatings.
- In flow, the chains are mobile and can move with the water, producing dynamic steric hindrance that prevents particles, proteins and bacteria from anchoring.
- The chemistry of the brush can be chosen to impart hydrophilicity and a desired surface charge, adding electrostatic repulsion to steric effects.

---

## 4. Typical synthesis route (three main steps)
1. Form the base membrane
   - Create a thin-film composite polyamide RO membrane by conventional interfacial polymerization on a porous support. This is standard for commercial RO membranes.

2. Activate the membrane surface with atmospheric-pressure plasma
   - Use atmospheric-pressure plasma to generate active sites (radicals, functional groups) on the polyamide surface.
   - Atmospheric-pressure plasma can be applied continuously and roll-to-roll (no vacuum chamber), which is compatible with large-area membrane production.

3. Graft polymerize a brush layer
   - Expose the plasma-activated surface to a monomer solution. The active sites initiate graft polymerization, creating covalently tethered polymer chains (the brush).
   - Control of reaction time and temperature allows tuning of brush thickness and topography.

Notes:
- The graft polymerization conditions (monomer type, concentration, time, temperature) determine brush density, chain length and surface properties (hydrophilicity, charge).
- Atmospheric-pressure plasma eliminates the need for vacuum equipment and can be applied selectively or continuously.

---

## 5. How polymer brushes prevent fouling — mechanisms
- Steric hindrance: The mobile polymer chains form a dynamic barrier; contaminants cannot easily reach and adhere to the underlying membrane surface.
- Dynamic motion: Flow-induced movement of chains (and thermal motion) makes it difficult for bacteria or proteins to make multiple binding interactions needed for stable attachment.
- Hydration layer: Hydrophilic brushes hold water near the surface, forming a hydration layer that reduces adsorption of hydrophobic species and proteins.
- Electrostatic repulsion: Selecting brush chemistry allows tuning of surface charge so the membrane repels similarly charged species (or attracts/neutralizes as needed).
- Stability: Because brushes are covalently tethered, they are less prone to washout than physically coated layers.

Analogy: imagine kelp moving in a current — continuous motion and flexible structure make it hard for organisms to anchor.

---

## 6. Advantages over other treatments
- Improved durability compared with physically coated films.
- High water permeability retained because brush thickness and porosity can be controlled.
- Can achieve both high salt rejection and long-term stability.
- Atmospheric-pressure plasma enables scalable, economical roll-to-roll production—no vacuum chambers required.
- Ability to tailor surface charge and hydrophilicity for different feed waters.

---

## 7. Practical considerations and challenges
- Optimization required for different water sources: brackish water, seawater, wastewater have different fouling tendencies and chemistries.
- Control of brush thickness and density is critical: too thick may reduce permeation; too thin may not prevent fouling.
- Long-term chemical stability under cleaning protocols (oxidants, acids, bases) must be verified.
- Field testing is needed under real operating conditions to assess performance and longevity.
- Cost-benefit analysis must account for production costs, reduced cleaning frequency, energy savings and membrane lifetime.

---

## 8. Potential impacts
- Reduced chemical use for cleaning and less frequent membrane replacement lower operating costs.
- Improved energy efficiency due to sustained higher permeability and lower fouling-induced pressure requirements.
- Makes desalination more economical and more viable as an alternative water resource, particularly where water scarcity is an issue.

---

## 9. Suggested classroom/lab activities
1. Conceptual exercise
   - Compare and contrast fouling mechanisms for different feed waters (seawater vs. wastewater). Propose brush chemistries that would be effective for each case and justify choices based on hydrophilicity and charge.

2. Simple modeling activity
   - Model how a tethered polymer layer thickness affects solute flux using a one-dimensional diffusion-resistance approach. Discuss trade-offs between fouling protection and permeability.

3. Lab demonstration (safe, conceptual)
   - Observe how polymer-coated surfaces resist protein adsorption: coat glass slides with hydrophilic polymer vs. untreated slides, expose to a colored protein solution (e.g., food-safe gelatin + dye), rinse, and compare staining intensity. This demonstrates adsorption differences qualitatively (do not use hazardous materials; follow safety protocols).

---

## 10. Discussion questions
- How would you select a monomer for a brush intended to prevent biofouling from bacteria-rich wastewater?
- What are the trade-offs between increasing brush thickness to reduce fouling and maintaining high water flux?
- How does atmospheric-pressure plasma change the economics of membrane surface modification?
- What tests would you perform in pilot-field studies to evaluate these membranes?

3. Short answer: Name the three overall steps used to synthesize the membrane.
   Solution: (1) Synthesize a polyamide thin-film composite membrane via interfacial polymerization; (2) activate the polyamide surface with atmospheric pressure plasma to create active sites; (3) initiate graft polymerization with a monomer solution to create a polymer brush layer.

4. Multiple choice: The polymer brush layer is tethered (chemically anchored). One immediate consequence stated is:
   A) It dissolves in water
   B) It is less thermally stable than physical coatings
   C) It is more thermally stable than physically coated polymer films
   D) It requires vacuum to remain stable  
   Solution: C

5. Short answer: Give two mechanisms by which the brush layer reduces fouling.
   Solution: (1) Constant motion of polymer chains prevents bacteria/colloids from anchoring; (2) the surface charge of the brush layer can be chosen to electrostatically repel oppositely charged foulants.

Medium (5)
6. Short answer: Explain why atmospheric pressure plasma is preferable to earlier plasma treatments for commercialization of long membrane rolls.
   Solution: Earlier plasma treatment required vacuum chambers, impractical and costly for thousands of meters of membrane; atmospheric pressure plasma allows treating surfaces without vacuum, like "brushing" the surface, making it compatible with continuous large-scale production.

7. Short answer: What performance characteristics did the researchers report for the new membrane besides anti-scaling?
   Solution: High water permeability, high rejection characteristics (i.e., effective salt/impurity rejection), and long-term stability.

8. Short answer: The graft polymerization stage is controlled by two parameters mentioned. What are they, and why are they important?
   Solution: Time (reaction period) and temperature. They control brush layer thickness and topography, which affect anti-fouling performance and permeability.

9. Multiple choice: Which collaborators or centers were explicitly mentioned as working with the research team?
   A) UCLA WaTeR Center and industry/water agencies
   B) NASA and the Department of Energy
   C) WHO and UNICEF
   D) NOAA and EPA  
   Solution: A

10. Short answer: State one near-term goal the team plans with respect to membrane development.
    Solution: Expand membrane synthesis into a larger, continuous process and optimize membrane performance (surface properties/brush layers) for different water sources to create a membrane selection system.

Hard (5)
11. Analytical short answer: Describe, in mechanistic terms based on the text, why a moving polymer brush layer reduces the probability of bacterial attachment compared with a static smooth membrane surface.
    Solution: Bacterial/protein adhesion requires establishing multiple contact points to resist shear and stay attached. Tethered polymer chains are constantly moving and present a dynamic, uneven topography; flow-induced motion of the chains makes it difficult for a bacterium to form stable multiple anchor points, while the polymer chains also physically screen the underlying surface. This reduces adhesion energy and attachment probability.

12. Critical reasoning: The text claims the brush layer can impart surface charge to repel molecules of opposite charge. Explain how this feature could be used to reduce fouling in brackish water (which has mixed ions and organic matter). What trade-offs or complications might arise?
    Solution: Imparting a net negative (or positive) charge can electrostatically repel similarly charged colloids/proteins, reducing adhesion of charged foulants. For brackish water with mixed ions, selecting a charge that repels the predominant foulants reduces fouling. Trade-offs: charged surfaces may attract counter-ions (screening) or encourage scaling by opposite-charged mineral ions; changing charge could affect salt rejection or interaction with cleaning chemistries; the heterogeneous nature of real waters means a single charge may not repel all foulants.

13. Design/analysis: Propose two measurable performance metrics (with brief justification) you would monitor in a field trial to assess whether membranes with brush layers truly reduce operational costs compared to commercial membranes.
    Solution: (1) Flux decline rate over time (L/m2·h decline per day) — shows fouling rate and cleaning frequency requirement. (2) Frequency and severity of required chemical cleanings and membrane replacements (costs and downtime) — directly tied to operational cost. Additional useful metrics: salt rejection efficiency and energy consumption (pump pressure vs. throughput).

14. Calculation/estimate (conceptual): Suppose a membrane system needs less frequent chemical cleaning due to brush-layer membranes. Describe qualitatively how reduced cleaning frequency translates into lower cost components (list at least three) and which of those would be most immediately observable on operational logs.
    Solution: Reduced cleaning frequency lowers (1) chemical costs for cleaning agents, (2) labor and downtime costs for performing cleaning, (3) wear-and-tear/membrane replacement costs, (4) energy/time losses due to offline sections. Most immediately observable: fewer cleaning events logged and reduced chemical procurement/usage records.

15. Synthesis: The researchers claim that structuring the surface "does not require a long reaction time, high reaction temperature or the use of a vacuum chamber." Explain why each of those three absences is advantageous for industrial adoption.
    Solution: No long reaction time increases throughput and reduces manufacturing time per unit; no high temperatures reduce energy cost and risk of thermal damage to substrates; no vacuum chamber eliminates costly infrastructure and scale limitations, enabling continuous roll-to-roll processing and lower capital expenditure.

Exam 2 — Applied engineering and design
(Instructions: Use reasoning strictly based on the described research. Show brief justifications.)

Easy (5)
1. Short answer: List the three main layers/components formed on the membrane from base to outermost after full synthesis.
   Solution: Base substrate (support layer) — polyamide thin-film composite membrane — tethered polymer brush layer (outermost).

2. Multiple choice: Which process produces the initial polyamide thin-film composite membrane?
   A) Electrospinning
   B) Interfacial polymerization
   C) Plasma polymerization
   D) Thermal lamination  
   Solution: B

3. Short answer: Give one advantage of chemically anchored brush chains over physically coated polymer films mentioned in the text.
   Solution: Chemically anchored chains are more thermally stable.

4. Short answer: What environmental or operational challenge does the new membrane specifically aim to reduce in desalination plants?
   Solution: Scaling and fouling (clogging), which increase pumping energy demands and necessitate costly cleaning/replacement.

5. Short answer: State one way water flow interacts with the brush layer to produce anti-fouling effects.
   Solution: Water flow induces movement of polymer chains, increasing dynamic motion that prevents particle/bacterial anchoring.

Medium (5)
6. Process design: Sketch (describe in words) a continuous roll-to-roll production step incorporating atmospheric pressure plasma treatment between interfacial polymerization and graft polymerization. Identify at least three process control variables that must be monitored.
   Solution: Description: After interfacial polymerization producing polyamide on a rolled substrate, the roll passes under an atmospheric pressure plasma array that scans/“brushes” the surface to create active sites; immediately downstream the activated strip is exposed to a controlled monomer solution (e.g., via a coatingor spraying station) and then conveyed through a temperature-controlled zone for graft polymerization for a set time before curing and rewinding. Control variables: plasma power/intensity and scan speed (dose), exposure time to monomer (residence time), temperature of graft polymerization zone, monomer concentration, roll speed/tension.

7. Short answer: Why is control of brush layer thickness and topography important for membrane performance?
   Solution: Thickness and topography balance permeability (thicker/denser brushes may impede water flux) and antifouling (adequate thickness/mobility needed to block adhesion). Precise control ensures high water permeability while maintaining anti-scaling properties.

8. Short answer: Identify two categories of foulants that the membrane aims to reject or resist.
   Solution: Mineral salt ions (scaling) and biological/colloidal matter (bacteria, proteins, colloids).

9. Short answer: The team plans to create a "membrane selection system" for different water sources. List two input parameters that such a selection system should consider.
   Solution: (1) Fouling tendencies of the water (types/concentrations of foulants — mineral content, organic load, microbial load). (2) Water salinity and ionic composition; also operational parameters like required flux and allowable cleaning frequency.

10. Short answer: Name one immediate experimental advantage of using atmospheric pressure plasma as described.
    Solution: It allows treating almost any surface without vacuum, facilitating scalable continuous processing.

Hard (5)
11. Quantitative conceptual design: Suppose you are to design the graft polymerization zone in a continuous process where residence time t and temperature T jointly determine brush thickness h by the simplified relation h = k · t^α · exp(βT), where k, α, β are constants determined experimentally. Explain how you would experimentally determine k, α, β using only batch reactors and what key measurements you would take.
    Solution: Run a set of controlled graft polymerizations in batch reactors varying t and T systematically (e.g., t values at fixed T to get h vs t, and T values at fixed t to get h vs T). Measure resulting brush thickness h (e.g., ellipsometry or AFM) for each condition. Fit data to ln(h) = ln(k) + α ln(t) + βT (if exp(βT) with T in appropriate units) or transform appropriately and perform multivariate regression to extract ln(k), α, β. Ensure coverage of parameter space to avoid collinearity.

12. Experimental planning: Design a controlled lab experiment to demonstrate that the brush layer's motion (not just its presence) contributes to anti-fouling. Describe control samples, measurable outcome, and expected result that supports the claim.
    Solution: Prepare three membrane samples: (A) untreated polyamide (no brush), (B) polyamide with tethered brush layer but immobilized (e.g., crosslinked to restrict motion), (C) polyamide with normal tethered mobile brush layer. Expose all to a flowing suspension of fluorescently labeled bacteria under identical shear. Measure adhered bacteria density after set time via fluorescence microscopy and quantify detachment under increased shear. Expected: A high adhesion in A, intermediate in B, and lowest in C, demonstrating motion contributes beyond mere physical presence. Additional controls: same chemistry for B and C to isolate motion effect.

13. Troubleshooting: In scale-up you observe that membranes made at higher line speed have patches with inadequate brush coverage. List three likely causes related to plasma treatment and suggest remediation for each.
    Solution: (1) Insufficient plasma dose due to too-fast scanning — slow line speed or increase plasma power; (2) uneven plasma uniformity across width — adjust electrode geometry, use multiple plasma heads, or optimize head-to-surface distance; (3) inadequate residence time between activation and monomer application causing rapid deactivation of active sites — reduce delay, add inert atmosphere/enclosurization, or locally store activated surface under suitable conditions.

14. Cost-benefit analysis (short essay, ~4–6 sentences): Argue quantitatively (conceptual, not numerical) why increased membrane life and decreased chemical cleaning can reduce overall desalination costs even if the membrane unit cost is moderately higher. Mention at least three cost categories affected.
    Solution: Higher upfront membrane cost is amortized over a longer lifespan, reducing replacement frequency and capital expenditure per unit volume treated. Reduced chemical cleaning lowers recurring costs for cleaning agents and disposal, and reduces labor and downtime—improving plant throughput and reducing effective unit energy cost per m3. Less frequent cleaning also reduces membrane wear, further saving replacement costs. Additionally, lower fouling reduces required pumping energy (lower pressure/less frequent pressure increases), reducing operational energy expense. Combined, these recurring savings typically outweigh a moderate increase in initial membrane price.

Given dataset (hypothetical): Two membrane types tested in identical RO modules under the same feed water: Commercial membrane (C) and Brush-layer membrane (B). Initial flux = 50 L/m2·h for both. After 30 days continuous operation:
- Flux for C = 30 L/m2·h
- Flux for B = 44 L/m2·h

1. Calculation: Compute percent flux decline for each membrane.
   Solution: C: decline = (50-30)/50 = 20/50 = 40%. B: decline = (50-44)/50 = 6/50 = 12%.

2. Short answer: Which membrane shows better fouling resistance and why?
   Solution: B shows better fouling resistance because its flux decline (12%) is much smaller than C's (40%), indicating less fouling.

3. Multiple choice: If cleaning restores flux to 95% of initial for both membranes, what will be flux after cleaning for C?
   A) 47.5 L/m2·h
   B) 45 L/m2·h
   C) 50 L/m2·h
   D) 30 L/m2·h  
   Solution: A (95% of 50 = 47.5)

4. Short answer: If membrane B requires cleaning once every 90 days and C every 30 days, how many cleanings per year for each?
   Solution: B: 365/90 ≈ 4 cleanings/year (actually 4.05 → 4). C: 365/30 ≈ 12 cleanings/year.

5. Short answer: List two operational metrics that these simple numbers (flux decline and cleaning frequency) directly impact.
   Solution: Energy consumption per unit water (due to pressure and reduced flux), chemical and labor costs for cleaning (operational expenditure), and downtime/throughput.

Medium (5)
6. Interpretation: If the plant treats 10,000 m2 of membrane area, calculate the volumetric throughput loss after 30 days for each membrane compared to initial flux (in m3/day). Use initial flux 50 L/m2·h.
   Solution: Initial throughput: 50 L/m2·h × 10,000 m2 = 500,000 L/h = 500 m3/h. Convert to per day: 500 m3/h × 24 = 12,000 m3/day. After 30 days: C flux 30 L/m2·h → 30 ×10,000=300,000 L/h=300 m3/h→7200 m3/day. Loss = 12,000 - 7,200 = 4,800 m3/day. B flux 44 L/m2·h → 44×10,000=440,000 L/h=440 m3/h→10,560 m3/day. Loss = 12,000 - 10,560 = 1,440 m3/day.

7. Cost inference: If lost throughput is valued at operating margin of $0.10 per m3, compute daily revenue loss due to fouling for each membrane after 30 days.
   Solution: C: 4,800 m3/day × $0.10 = $480/day. B: 1,440 m3/day × $0.10 = $144/day.

8. Hypothesis testing: You measure bacterial adhesion densities (cells/cm2) after exposure: C = 1.2×10^6, B = 2.5×10^5. State whether the data support the claim that brush layer reduces bacterial attachment and justify.
   Solution: Yes — bacterial adhesion on B (2.5×10^5) is ~5 times lower than on C (1.2×10^6), consistent with reduced attachment due to brush layer.

9. Data critique: If for membrane B salt rejection decreased slightly from 99.5% to 99.2% over 30 days while C remained at 99.5%, discuss possible explanations consistent with the membrane description.
   Solution: Slight decline in rejection for B could be due to the added polymer brush layer altering effective pore structure or interacting with ionic transport, or partial compaction or rearrangement of brush leading to momentary pathways. Alternatively, fouling of B by specific ions (due to chosen surface charge attracting counter-ions) could slightly reduce rejection. Because B maintains higher flux, trade-offs between permeability and selectivity may cause small selectivity shifts.

10. Design suggestion: Propose one simple additional measurement to corroborate whether the brush mobility, rather than chemistry alone, is responsible for reduced bacterial adhesion in the lab.
    Solution: Measure adhesion under static and dynamic conditions for the same membrane — compare adhesion in no-flow (static incubation) versus under flow; greater relative reduction under flow indicates mobility-related effects. Alternatively compare membrane with same chemistry but crosslinked (immobilized) vs. mobile brush.

Hard (5)
11. Modeling: Assume fouling leads to an exponential decay of flux F(t) = F0·e^{-λt}. Using the observed fluxes at t=30 days (F0=50 L/m2·h), compute λ for membranes C (F=30) and B (F=44). Provide λ in days^-1.
    Solution: λ = -(1/t) ln(F(t)/F0). For C: λ_C = -1/30 * ln(30/50) = -1/30 * ln(0.6) = -1/30 * (-0.5108) = 0.01703 day^-1. For B: λ_B = -1/30 * ln(44/50) = -1/30 * ln(0.88) = -1/30 * (-0.1278) = 0.00426 day^-1.

12. Prediction: Using the λ values above, predict flux for each membrane at t = 90 days.
    Solution: F(90)=50·e^{-λ·90}. For C: exp(-0.01703*90)=exp(-1.5327)=0.2159 → F=50*0.2159=10.8 L/m2·h. For B: exp(-0.00426*90)=exp(-0.3834)=0.6816 → F=50*0.6816=34.08 L/m2·h.

13. Sensitivity analysis: If cleaning restores flux to 95% but cleaning costs $500 per event per 1000 m2 of membrane, estimate annual cleaning cost for the 10,000 m2 plant using the cleaning frequencies from question 4 (B: ~4/year, C: ~12/year). Which membrane yields lower annual cleaning cost and by how much?
    Solution: Cleaning cost per 1000 m2 = $500. For 10,000 m2 it's 10×: $5,000 per cleaning. Annual: B: 4×$5,000 = $20,000. C: 12×$5,000 = $60,000. Savings = $40,000 per year for B.

14. Critical synthesis: Based on the hypothetical performance data and earlier descriptions, write a concise recommendation (~3 sentences) to a plant manager considering retrofit: include performance, economic, and any caveats.
    Solution: Recommendation: The brush-layer membranes show markedly lower flux decline and reduced bacterial adhesion, translating to higher delivered throughput and substantially lower cleaning costs (estimated $40k/year savings for a 10,000 m2 plant) and fewer interruptions. Caveats include verifying long-term salt rejection stability, assessing membrane purchase price premium, and validating performance under the plant's specific feedwater chemistry via a field trial before full retrofit.

15. Experimental extension (design): Propose a 6-month field trial plan (3 bullets: primary objective, key measurements, success criteria) for the brush-layer membranes at a municipal plant.
    Solution: Objective: Compare long-term operational performance (flux decline, cleaning frequency, salt rejection, and energy use) of brush-layer vs. commercial membranes under real feedwater. Key measurements: continuous flux and pressure monitoring, salt rejection tests weekly, record of cleaning events/chemicals, microbial/colloidal sampling, and membrane inspection post-trial. Success criteria: ≥50% reduction in cleaning frequency, ≤15% additional unit cost when amortized over lifecycle, and maintained salt rejection within acceptable regulatory limits.

Exam 4 — Terminology, sequencing, and policy brief
(Instructions: Answer succinctly. Use only the information provided.)

Easy (5)
1. Define: Reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination — 1–2 sentences.
   Solution: RO desalination uses high pressure to force polluted water through a semipermeable membrane; water molecules pass through pores while salts, bacteria and impurities are retained, producing purified water.

2. Multiple choice: "Scaling" in membrane systems primarily refers to:
   A) Increasing membrane size
   B) Deposition of mineral salts on surfaces
   C) Biological growth only
   D) Manufacturing membranes in large scale  
   Solution: B

3. Short answer: What is meant by a "polymer brush layer"?
   Solution: A layer of polymer chains chemically tethered (anchored) to a surface so that chains extend away from the surface like bristles of a brush.

4. True/False: Atmospheric pressure plasma requires a vacuum chamber to function.
   Solution: False

5. Short answer: Name one journal in which the team's findings were published.
   Solution: Journal of Materials Chemistry (and a preliminary paper appeared in Journal of Membrane Science).

Medium (5)
6. Sequencing: Put these steps of the membrane synthesis in correct order: (A) Graft polymerization with monomer solution, (B) Interfacial polymerization to form polyamide thin film, (C) Activation by atmospheric pressure plasma.
   Solution: Order: B → C → A.

7. Short explanation: Why do tethered polymer chains provide more thermal stability than physically coated films?
   Solution: Tethered chains are chemically anchored to the substrate, preventing detachment or flow at elevated temperature, whereas physically coated films can delaminate, flow or reorganize under heat.

8. Matching (match left to right):
   - (i) Fouling
   - (ii) Rejection characteristic
   - (iii) Brush topography
   A) Ability to keep salts/impurities out
   B) Surface structure that affects mobility and adhesion
   C) Accumulation of particles/biofilms on surface  
   Solution: (i)-C, (ii)-A, (iii)-B

9. Short answer: The team mentions being able to "choose the chemistry of the brush layer." Name two membrane properties that this choice can directly influence.
   Solution: Surface charge (thus electrostatic interactions), hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and therefore fouling propensity and specific interactions with foulants.

10. Short answer: Explain briefly why the research team works directly with industry and water agencies.
    Solution: To accelerate translation of technology to real-world solutions, ensure the research addresses practical issues, and provide students with experience collaborating with external stakeholders.

Hard (5)
11. Policy brief (short): Write a one-paragraph recommendation (3–5 sentences) for a municipal water authority considering pilot testing these membranes. Include benefits, a key risk, and a recommended mitigation.
    Solution: Recommendation: Pilot testing the brush-layer membranes is advisable because they promise significantly reduced fouling, higher sustained flux, and lower operational costs through fewer cleanings and longer membrane life—benefits that can improve reliability and reduce energy and chemical expenses. Key risk is uncertain long-term selectivity and performance under the authority’s specific feedwater chemistry, which could slightly alter salt rejection or promote unexpected interactions. Mitigation: conduct a controlled, instrumented field trial comparing membranes side-by-side with robust monitoring of flux, rejection, cleaning needs, and chemical interactions before committing to full-scale adoption.

12. Analytical: The text compares plasma in the "early years" to atmospheric pressure plasma. Summarize the main technological limitation of early plasma treatments and how atmospheric plasma overcomes it. Then discuss one manufacturing implication.
    Solution: Limitation: Early plasma treatments required vacuum chambers, making them impractical and costly for processing thousands of meters of continuous membrane due to limited chamber size and throughput. Atmospheric plasma eliminates the need for vacuum, enabling in-line, non-vacuum "brushing" of surfaces. Manufacturing implication: Enables continuous roll-to-roll processing at industrial speeds, reducing capital costs and enabling scalable production of modified membranes.

13. Ethics/impact: Briefly discuss one social or environmental benefit and one potential environmental concern associated with widespread adoption of these membranes.
    Solution: Benefit: More economical desalination could expand access to potable water, reduce dependence on scarce freshwater sources, and support communities facing water scarcity. Concern: Increased desalination capacity could increase brine discharge volumes; if not managed, concentrated brine could harm marine environments—thus adoption must be coupled with responsible brine management.

14. Research critique: The team proposes selecting brush chemistries for different fouling tendencies. Identify two experimental challenges they are likely to face in creating a robust "membrane selection system."
    Solution: (1) Heterogeneity and temporal variability of real feedwaters (seasonal changes, multiple foulants) make mapping a single brush chemistry to a water type complex. (2) Interactions between surface charge and mixed ionic species or organics may produce unexpected scaling or attraction of counter-ions, requiring extensive empirical testing across many compositions.

15. Integration: Propose (in 4–6 sentences) how the combination of high permeability and anti-fouling could alter the energy footprint of an RO desalination plant, being specific about mechanisms.
    Solution: High permeability reduces the pressure needed to achieve a given flux, directly lowering pump energy consumption per unit water treated. Anti-fouling maintains higher effective permeability over time, reducing the need for increased pressure or higher energy operations to compensate for flux decline. Fewer cleanings and membrane replacements mean less energy spent on cleaning processes and manufacturing/disposal. Together, these mechanisms reduce both operational and lifecycle energy footprints of the plant.

Exam 5 — Case study and project planning
(Instructions: Assume you are the lead engineer proposing a pilot commercialization program. Use only the facts and directions implicit in the research description.)

Easy (5)
1. Short answer: State the immediate technological novelty you would highlight in a funding pitch.
   Solution: Use of atmospheric pressure plasma to create a tethered polymer brush layer on polyamide RO membranes that confers strong anti-fouling and anti-scaling properties while being compatible with continuous, large-scale production.

2. Short answer: Give two direct operational benefits to emphasize in the pitch.
   Solution: Reduced cleaning frequency/chemical use and extended membrane lifetime (lower replacement costs), plus maintained high water permeability and high rejection.

3. Short answer: Name one partner type (organization) you would seek for a field trial.
   Solution: A municipal water agency or an industrial water user with available pilot RO facilities (or industry partners/manufacturers of membranes).

4. Multiple choice: Which of the following is a reasonable first technical milestone for a pilot program?
   A) Full global commercialization
   B) Laboratory proof-of-concept
   C) Continuous synthesis demonstration at pilot scale
   D) Publication in a new journal  
   Solution: C

5. Short answer: Identify one regulatory/quality parameter you must ensure during pilot testing.
   Solution: Maintained salt rejection to meet potable water standards (e.g., relevant regulatory limits for conductivity or ionic concentrations).

Medium (5)
6. Project plan (bullet list): Outline 5 milestones with approximate chronological order for a 12-month pilot commercialization project.
   Solution:
   - Month 0–2: Design and set up pilot roll-to-roll synthesis line (plasma head, monomer application, temperature zone).
   - Month 2–4: Produce pilot-scale membrane rolls and perform QA (thickness, coverage, rejection) in lab.
   - Month 4–6: Install membrane modules in partner plant for side-by-side trials with commercial membranes.
   - Month 6–10: Operate continuous trial, collecting flux, rejection, cleaning frequency, and microbial/foulant data.
   - Month 10–12: Analyze data, prepare techno-economic assessment, and propose scale-up/commercialization decision.

7. Risk assessment: List three principal technical risks for scaling and one mitigation measure for each.
   Solution:
   - Risk: Nonuniform plasma activation across wide web → Mitigation: Use multiple plasma heads and mapping/feedback control to ensure uniform dose.
   - Risk: Rapid deactivation of active sites before grafting → Mitigation: Minimize transport time between plasma and monomer application; design enclosed/controlled atmosphere conveyance.
   - Risk: Altered salt rejection after brush grafting → Mitigation: Optimize brush thickness/topography via controlled reaction time and temperature; perform iterative lab optimization prior to roll-out.

8. Financial estimate (conceptual): Identify three categories of costs to include in a pilot budget and one expected source of cost savings if pilot succeeds.
   Solution: Costs: capital equipment for pilot production (plasma heads, coating/oven), materials and labor for membrane production, field trial operational costs (installation, monitoring). Expected saving if successful: reduced operational expenditure from fewer cleanings and longer membrane life.

9. Stakeholder communication: Draft a one-sentence message to plant operators summarizing why they should allow a side-by-side trial.
   Solution: A side-by-side trial can demonstrate reduced fouling and cleaning needs in your real feedwater conditions, potentially increasing throughput and reducing operational costs with minimal disruption.

Hard (5)
10. Technical proposal (short essay, ~6–8 sentences): Propose a detailed experimental protocol for the field trial comparing brush-layer membranes to the plant's current membranes, including sample size (number of modules), controls, duration, measured endpoints, and statistical considerations.
    Solution: Use at least 6 RO modules in parallel: 3 fitted with pilot brush-layer membranes and 3 with the plant’s current commercial membranes as controls, ensuring identical hydraulic and feed conditions. Operate continuously for 6–12 months to capture short- and medium-term fouling behaviors. Measured endpoints: flux and transmembrane pressure logged continuously, periodic salt rejection assays (daily/weekly), record of cleaning events (frequency, chemicals used, downtime), microbial/colloidal sampling weekly, and post-trial membrane autopsies (SEM/AFM, foulant composition). Ensure randomization of module positions and rotate modules mid-trial if feasible to control for local feed heterogeneity. Statistical plan: use repeated-measures ANOVA or mixed-effects models to compare flux decline rates and cleaning frequency between groups, with significance threshold p<0.05 and power calculation to detect at least a 25% difference in cleaning frequency. Success criteria: statistically significant reduction in fouling rate and cleaning events with maintained rejection.

11. Technical calculation: Assume each cleaning event takes a module offline for 4 hours and causes production loss equal to that module’s nominal hourly throughput. For a plant with 6 parallel modules each of area 1666.7 m2 (so total 10,000 m2), using initial flux 50 L/m2·h, compute the production loss per cleaning event (in m3) for the plant. Then compute annual loss for C (12 cleanings/year) and B (4 cleanings/year).
    Solution: Nominal throughput per module: total area 10,000/6 ≈ 1666.6667 m2. Hourly flux per module: 50 L/m2·h × 1666.667 = 83,333.35 L/h = 83.33335 m3/h. Offline 4 hours → loss per cleaning per module = 4 × 83.33335 = 333.3334 m3. For whole plant if one module cleaned at a time, loss per event = 333.3334 m3. Annual loss: C (12 events) = 12×333.3334 = 4,000.0008 m3/year. B (4 events) = 4×333.3334 = 1,333.3336 m3/year.

12. Lifecycle assessment sketch: Specify 4 data points you would need to calculate cradle-to-grave energy/carbon payback time for switching to brush-layer membranes, and briefly explain how each factor influences payback.
    Solution:
    - Incremental embedded energy/carbon in manufacturing brush-layer membranes vs. standard membranes (higher production energy increases payback time).
    - Change in operational energy consumption (pump energy savings from higher permeability or lower fouling) across plant lifetime (reductions accelerate payback).
    - Change in frequency of membrane replacement and disposal impacts (fewer replacements reduce lifecycle energy and carbon).
    - Change in chemical use and associated emissions from cleaning (less chemical use shortens payback by avoiding production and disposal emissions).

13. Final recommendation (policy + technical, ~4–5 sentences): Given the benefits and uncertainties described, recommend whether to proceed to pilot commercialization, and specify two conditions that must be met before full-scale rollout.
    Solution: Recommendation: Proceed to a structured pilot commercialization—side-by-side field trials are justified given clear benefits in reduced fouling, higher sustained flux, and potential operational savings. Conditions before full-scale rollout: (1) Demonstrated long-term retention of required salt rejection and absence of adverse effects in the plant’s specific feedwater over a statistically robust trial; (2) successful scale-up of uniform plasma activation and brush application with validated QA metrics ensuring reproducible coverage and controlled brush thickness across full membrane widths. If these are met and techno-economic analysis shows lifecycle cost savings, proceed to phased adoption.

- Activate prior knowledge: I know reverse osmosis uses pressure and membranes; fouling and scaling are common problems. Polymer brushes can resist fouling, and plasma treatment can functionalize surfaces. Atmospheric pressure plasma sounds more scalable than vacuum plasma.

---

> Hold the salt: UCLA engineers develop revolutionary new desalination membrane

Reader thinking:
- This promises a big improvement — "revolutionary" is a strong claim. I'll watch for evidence and specifics.

> Process uses atmospheric pressure plasma to create filtering 'brush layer'

Reader thinking:
- "Brush layer" likely means polymer brushes tethered to the membrane surface. Atmospheric pressure plasma — likely for surface activation without vacuum. Good for scalability?

> Desalination can become more economical and used as a viable alternate water resource.
> By Wileen Wong Kromhout
> Originally published in UCLA Newsroom

Reader thinking:
- Economic claim — look for cost-reduction mechanisms (energy, cleaning, replacement).

---

> Researchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have unveiled a new class of reverse-osmosis membranes for desalination that resist the clogging which typically occurs when seawater, brackish water and waste water are purified.

Annotate / Questions:
- Key claim: resists clogging (fouling and scaling). How much better? Under what tests?
- What types of fouling? Biological (biofouling), colloidal, scaling (mineral), organic?

> The highly permeable, surface-structured membrane can easily be incorporated into today's commercial production system, the researchers say, and could help to significantly reduce desalination operating costs. Their findings appear in the current issue of the Journal of Materials Chemistry.

Paraphrase:
- Membrane is both highly permeable and surface-structured; compatible with existing manufacturing and may lower operating costs.

Question:
- "Easily incorporated" — what modifications are needed to commercial lines? Cost to retrofit?

Pause & summarize so far:
- New RO membrane from UCLA resists fouling using a surface structure (brush layer) and claims compatibility with existing production — promising for practical uptake.

---

> Reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination uses high pressure to force polluted water through the pores of a membrane. While water molecules pass through the pores, mineral salt ions, bacteria and other impurities cannot. Over time, these particles build up on the membrane's surface, leading to clogging and membrane damage. This scaling and fouling places higher energy demands on the pumping system and necessitates costly cleanup and membrane replacement.

Annotate:
- Useful background — confirms the problem (fouling increases energy and maintenance costs).

Connection:
- Matches prior knowledge: fouling increases transmembrane pressure needed and cleaning cycles.

Question:
- Are they measuring reduced transmembrane pressure rise over time? Or longer cleaning intervals?

---

> The new UCLA membrane's novel surface topography and chemistry allow it to avoid such drawbacks.

Reader thinking:
- Expect description of topography and chemistry next — how formed and how they work together.

---

> "Besides possessing high water permeability, the new membrane also shows high rejection characteristics and long-term stability," said Nancy H. Lin, a UCLA Engineering senior researcher and the study's lead author. "Structuring the membrane surface does not require a long reaction time, high reaction temperature or the use of a vacuum chamber. The anti-scaling property, which can increase membrane life and decrease operational costs, is superior to existing commercial membranes."

Annotate / Paraphrase:
- Claims: high permeability, high salt rejection, long-term stability, scalable manufacturing (no long reaction time, no vacuum), superior anti-scaling vs commercial membranes.

Question:
- What metrics quantify "superior"? Flux (L/m2·h), salt rejection (%), fouling rates, duration before cleaning?

Thought:
- Avoiding vacuum chambers suggests atmospheric plasma is central to scalability.

---

> The new membrane was synthesized through a three-step process. First, researchers synthesized a polyamide thin-film composite membrane using conventional interfacial polymerization. Next, they activated the polyamide surface with atmospheric pressure plasma to create active sites on the surface. Finally, these active sites were used to initiate a graft polymerization reaction with a monomer solution to create a polymer "brush layer" on the polyamide surface. This graft polymerization is carried out for a specific period of time at a specific temperature in order to control the brush layer thickness and topography.

Annotate / Paraphrase (method summary):
- Step 1: Make standard polyamide thin-film composite (typical RO membrane).
- Step 2: Activate surface with atmospheric-pressure plasma → create active sites.
- Step 3: Graft polymerization from those sites to grow tethered polymer brushes; control thickness/topography by reaction time & temperature.

Question:
- Which monomers were used for the brush? Hydrophilic ones like PEGMA or zwitterionic monomers? (article hasn't said yet)
- How durable is the grafted layer under high pressure and shear?

Connection:
- "Graft-from" method yields tethered brushes (better durability than coated films).

Pause & mini-summary:
- They build on existing membrane chemistry and add a tethered polymer brush via atmospheric plasma activation, which should improve antifouling and be scalable.

---

> "In the early years, surface plasma treatment could only be accomplished in a vacuum chamber," said Yoram Cohen, UCLA professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and a corresponding author of the study. "It wasn't practical for large-scale commercialization because thousands of meters of membranes could not be synthesized in a vacuum chamber. It's too costly. But now, with the advent of atmospheric pressure plasma, we don't even need to initiate the reaction chemically. It's as simple as brushing the surface with plasma, and it can be done for almost any surface."

Annotate / Reaction:
- Atmospheric plasma as a 'brush' metaphor — implies roll-to-roll processing possible (good for scale).
- "We don't even need to initiate the reaction chemically" — atmospheric plasma probably generates radicals/functional groups directly.

Question:
- What equipment is required? Is there published data on throughput/line speed?

---

> In this new membrane, the polymer chains of the tethered brush layer are in constant motion. The chains are chemically anchored to the surface and are thus more thermally stable, relative to physically coated polymer films. Water flow also adds to the brush layer's movement, making it extremely difficult for bacteria and other colloidal matter to anchor to the surface of the membrane.

Visualize / Analogy:
- Polymer brush like kelp waving — dynamic motion prevents adhesion.

Thought:
- Mechanical movement at nanoscale likely decreases residence time for adhesion. Combined with hydration layers, this can reduce protein/bio adhesion.

Question:
- Does motion reduce particulate fouling (colloids) or mainly biofouling? Likely both to some extent.

---

> "If you've ever snorkeled, you'll know that sea kelp move back and forth with the current or water flow," Cohen said. "So imagine that you have this varied structure with continuous movement. Protein or bacteria need to be able to anchor to multiple spots on the membrane to attach themselves to the surface — a task which is extremely difficult to attain due to the constant motion of the brush layer. The polymer chains protect and screen the membrane surface underneath."

Annotate:
- Reinforces the kelp analogy; emphasizes need for multiple anchoring points for robust adhesion.

Critique / Question:
- Even if initial adhesion is reduced, could extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from bacteria eventually entangle brushes? Long-term field data needed.

---

> Another factor in preventing adhesion is the surface charge of the membrane. Cohen's team is able to choose the chemistry of the brush layer to impart the desired surface charge, enabling the membrane to repel molecules of an opposite charge.

Annotate:
- They can tune brush chemistry to alter surface charge — useful to repel charged foulants (e.g., negatively charged colloids or proteins).
- Dual mechanisms: steric (brush motion) + electrostatic repulsion.

Question:
- Do they report using zwitterionic brushes (known for anti-fouling) or charged brushes? Which charge/chemistries worked best?

---

> The team's next step is to expand the membrane synthesis into a much larger, continuous process and to optimize the new membrane's performance for different water sources.

Annotate:
- Scale-up and optimization for different feed waters — sensible next step.

Question:
- Any pilot-scale trials or partnerships with industry? Later paragraphs may say.

---

> "We want to be able to narrow down and create a membrane selection system for different water sources that have different fouling tendencies," Lin said. "With such knowledge, one can optimize the membrane surface properties with different polymer brush layers to delay or prevent the onset of membrane fouling and scaling.
> 
> "The cost of desalination will therefore decrease when we reduce the cost of chemicals [used for membrane cleaning], as well as process operation [for membrane replacement]. Desalination can become more economical and used as a viable alternate water resource."

Annotate / Paraphrase:
- They aim to develop a selection framework: match brush chemistry/topography to feedwater type to minimize fouling and cleaning chemical use.
- Economic claim: reduced cleaning/replacement lowers cost of desalination.

Question:
- Are there lifecycle or cost studies comparing these modified membranes to commercial ones (including modification cost)?

---

> Cohen's team, in collaboration with the UCLA Water Technology Research (WaTeR) Center, is currently carrying out specific studies to test the performance of the new membrane's fouling properties under field conditions.
> 
> "We work directly with industry and water agencies on everything that we're doing here in water technology," Cohen said. "The reason for this is simple: If we are to accelerate the transfer of knowledge technology from the university to the real world, where those solutions are needed, we have to make sure we address the real issues. This also provides our students with a tremendous opportunity to work with industry, government and local agencies."

Annotate:
- Field-condition testing underway — good sign for practical validation.
- Collaboration with industry and agencies increases chance of real-world trials.

Question:
- Any preliminary field results? Timescale to pilot/demonstration?

---

> A paper providing a preliminary introduction to the new membrane also appeared in the Journal of Membrane Science last month.
> 
> Published: Thursday, April 08, 2010

Annotate:
- Two publications: Journal of Materials Chemistry (main findings) and Journal of Membrane Science (preliminary). Good — can look up those articles for technical details (monomer type, flux/rejection numbers, fouling-test protocols).

Pause & consolidate understanding:
- What I learned: UCLA team added tethered polymer brushes to conventional polyamide RO membranes via atmospheric pressure plasma activation and graft polymerization. This produces a dynamic, charged surface that resists fouling (steric motion + electrostatics) and is claimed to be scalable and economically beneficial by reducing cleaning and replacement costs. Field testing and scale-up are planned.

## After Reading

1. Summary (without looking back):
   - UCLA researchers developed a reverse-osmosis membrane with a tethered polymer brush layer grown from an atmospheric-pressure-plasma-activated polyamide surface. The brush layer moves in the water flow and can be chemically tuned for surface charge, reducing fouling and scaling, improving permeability and stability. The process avoids vacuum plasma and long reactions, potentially enabling scalable production and lower desalination costs. Field testing and scale-up work are ongoing.

2. Review of annotations (high-level):
   - Strengths: builds on existing membrane tech; uses scalable atmospheric plasma; combines steric and electrostatic antifouling mechanisms; reported superior anti-scaling.
   - Missing details: specific monomers/chemistries used, quantitative performance metrics (flux, rejection, fouling rate), durability under real feed conditions and shear, cost analysis including modification cost, long-term field data.

3. Connections:
   - Similar to other anti-fouling strategies: PEGylation, zwitterionic polymers, and polymer brushes used in biomedical devices and membranes. Atmospheric plasma roll-to-roll processing could enable industrial adoption like coating lines.

4. Remaining questions to explore / generate for the authors:
   - Which monomers were used for the polymer brushes? Hydrophilic, zwitterionic, charged?
   - What are the quantitative results: water flux (L/m2·h), salt rejection (%), fouling rate comparisons vs commercial membranes, and test durations?
   - How does the brush layer affect membrane hydraulic resistance and long-term permeability?
   - What are the mechanical/chemical stability metrics (e.g., after X hours at operating pressure, chemical cleaning cycles)?
   - What is the projected added manufacturing cost per square meter of membrane, and the expected payback via reduced cleaning/replacement?
   - Are there pilot plant results yet? If so, what feedwaters (seawater, brackish, wastewater) were tested?

5. Reflection on application:
   - If the claims hold with pilot and long-term data, this could reduce operating costs for RO systems by lowering fouling-related downtime and cleaning chemical use. For utilities, this could make desalination more attractive, especially where brackish water or wastewater reuse is options.

6. Action items (if I wanted to follow up):
   - Look up the Journal of Materials Chemistry and Journal of Membrane Science papers by Nancy H. Lin and Yoram Cohen (2010) for technical data.
   - Search for subsequent publications or patents from Cohen's group about scale-up or field trials.
   - If evaluating for a project, request pilot test data or sample membranes from the research group or their industry partners.

Final thought (meta):
- The article is promising and logically consistent with known antifouling strategies. The key to judging impact will be quantitative performance and durability under real-world conditions plus cost-to-benefit analysis for manufacturing scale-up.

Not Just for Kids
The Hunt for Falling Leaves...
Nature's Color on the Ground
by Mary Catherine Ball
Being a reporter, I am always looking for an adventure. Last week, I found one.
I left work to go on a simple journey, but it turned out to be much more.
First, I crossed a mud-ridden stream. Then, I came face to face with flying creatures, fighting to get near me. I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze.
Where did I go? Into the woods, of course. Why? I wanted to gather some fallen leaves.
My luck was good that day. I was able to spy lots of different kinds of leaves lying on the ground. Some were leaves I had never seen. Some were still green, while others were changing to their autumn colors.
Have you ever hunted for leaves? I wonder if you know the names of five of the trees that live in your neighborhood? I bet the answer is no.
Well, me neither. So I had five of the leaves analyzed. I had found the leaves from an oak, a beech, a sweet gum tree and more.
Now, I invite you to make this journey.
Narrow body with pointy edges
Narrow body with pointy edges
May grow berries
Good for sap & color

### Summary
Mary Catherine Ball describes a small reporter’s adventure into the woods to hunt for fallen leaves. What began as a simple walk turned into a memorable outing: she crossed a muddy stream, encountered insects buzzing around her, and had spiders’ webs catch in her hair. In the leaf-strewn forest she discovered many kinds of leaves—some still green, others already shifting to autumn colors—some she had never seen before. Curious about the trees around her, she admitted she didn’t know the names of common neighborhood trees, so she had five of the leaves analyzed and identified examples including an oak, a beech and a sweet gum among others.

She invites readers to join a similar exploration: the page can be cut out and taken into the woods (in daylight) to match found leaves with the clues provided. A short set of descriptive clues is included to guide the hunt (phrases such as “narrow body with pointy edges,” “may grow berries,” “good for sap & color,” “3 distinct leafs,” and “may grow nuts”), suggesting characteristics to look for while identifying fallen leaves.

### Educational Material
# The Hunt for Falling Leaves

Take a walk into the woods, a park or along your street and become a leaf detective. Look closely, touch carefully, and record what you find. This guide gives simple clues, identification help, safety tips and follow-up activities so you can learn about trees while having fun.

Objective
- Find five different fallen leaves and match each to a clue.
- Observe and describe leaf features: shape, edge, arrangement, color, and any fruit or nuts nearby.
- Practice safe, respectful exploration of nature.

What to bring
- Paper bag or envelope (to hold leaves)
- Pencil and clipboard or small notebook
- Magnifying glass (optional)
- Scissors (optional, for trimming paper only) — do not cut live plants
- Camera or phone (optional, to take photos instead of collecting)
- Hand sanitizer or wipes

Safety and respect for nature
- Go during daylight and bring an adult if you are young.
- Do not touch plants you can’t identify (poison ivy grows in many areas; remember “Leaves of three — let it be”).
- Only collect fallen leaves. Do not remove leaves from living plants unless you have permission.
- Stay on paths where possible and watch footing near streams or wet ground.
- Return wildlife, rocks and living plants to where you found them.

Simple scavenger hunt — five clues
Find one fallen leaf that matches each clue. Put the leaves in your bag, label them, and record your observations.

1) Narrow, long leaf with many tiny pointed teeth along the edge
- Note color, size, surface texture, any veins you can see.

2) Narrow leaf with sharp, spiny points along the margin and sometimes red berries nearby
- Look under evergreen shrubs or near holly-like plants.

3) Broad, palm-shaped or star-shaped leaf with 3–7 pointed lobes (often looks like a star)
- Check for five-pointed or multi-lobed shapes lying flat on the ground.

4) Leaf with many deep rounded or pointed lobes; look nearby for hard nuts or acorns
- The leaf may be large and unevenly lobed.

5) Simple leaf with opposite leaf arrangement on the twig (if you can still find attached leaves or compare with nearby trees); often used for syrup and shows bright fall color
- Look for leaves that have 3–5 main lobes and a clear midrib.

Field record (one page per leaf)
- Clue number:
- Date / Time:
- Location:
- Leaf size (approx. cm or inches):
- Shape (narrow, oval, lobed, star-shaped, compound):
- Edge (smooth, toothed, spiny, lobed):
- Color(s) now:
- Nearby fruits/nuts/berries? (yes/no — describe)
- Any other notes or a sketch/photo:

How to use the clues
- Observe leaf shape first: is it simple (one blade) or compound (several leaflets)? Is the blade narrow, oval, lobed or star-shaped?
- Look at the edge (margin): smooth (entire), toothed/serrated, spiny, or deeply lobed.
- Check for arrangement on the twig, if possible: opposite (pairs across the stem) or alternate (one at each node alternating sides).
- Notice fruit on the ground: acorns, nuts, berries, or spiky seed pods help identify the tree.
- Match these features with the clue descriptions.

Common trees you might find (examples and what to look for)
- Birch: narrow, elongated leaves with fine serrations (toothed edges); light bark on the tree; leaves often small and delicate.
- Beech: smooth, elongated leaves with small teeth and distinct parallel veins; leaves are often strong and papery.
- Holly: glossy, narrow to oval leaves with sharp spiny points on the margin and often bright red berries (evergreen in many places).
- Sweetgum: star-shaped leaves with 5 pointed lobes; fall color can be brilliant red, purple or yellow; look for spiky gum balls on the ground.
- Oak: lobed leaves (rounded or pointed lobes depending on species), often near acorns (nuts); leaves may be large and heavy.
- Maple: palmately lobed (3–5 lobes) with opposite arrangement; good for bright fall colors and some species are tapped for sap.

(If you found a trifoliate leaf — three leaflets — be cautious: some trifoliate plants are harmless, others like poison ivy are not. Do not touch them; photograph and ask an adult.)

Activities to try after your hunt
- Leaf rubbing: place a leaf under paper and rub a crayon sideways to reveal vein patterns.
- Leaf press: flatten leaves in a heavy book for a week to preserve them for a nature journal.
- Create a color collage: arrange leaves by size, shape or color and glue onto paper.
- Match leaves to bark: stand near the tree each leaf came from (if you can find it) and sketch the bark, noting differences.
- Write a short story or poem inspired by the color and shape of a favorite leaf.

Questions to think about or discuss
- Which leaf had the most interesting edge? Why?
- How many different colors did you see among your five leaves?
- Which tree would you like to learn more about and why?
- How might the leaf shape help the tree survive (catch sunlight, lose water, resist wind)?

Glossary
- Blade: the flat part of the leaf.
- Margin: edge of the leaf (smooth, toothed, lobed, spiny).
- Vein: the lines that transport water and nutrients in the leaf.
- Simple leaf: a single leaf blade attached to the stem.
- Compound leaf: a leaf divided into multiple leaflets attached to one stalk.
- Alternate arrangement: leaves grow singly at different heights along the stem.
- Opposite arrangement: leaves grow in pairs at the same level on opposite sides of the stem.

Extension ideas for adults and groups
- Organize a short nature program: storytime, leaf crafts, and a guided walk for toddlers.
- Run a leaf-art contest: categories by age with prizes such as books or nature-themed items.
- Partner with a local park or nature center for a beginner tree-identification hike.

Reflection and recording
After your walk, enter your findings into a nature journal or digital album. Compare leaves you collected to field guides or online tree ID resources. Notice how different leaves are adapted to their tree’s life and to the changing seasons.

Happy leaf hunting — observe, respect, and enjoy the colors under your feet!

### Exams
Below are five different exam styles (you can pick the one you like best). Each exam contains 15 tasks: 5 easy, 5 medium, 5 hard. Every task is immediately followed by a model solution to help grading. The exams are in English.

-------------------------
EXAM 1 — Straight comprehension (mixed short-answer and multiple choice)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Who is the narrator of the piece?  
Answer: A reporter.

2. (Easy) List, in order presented, the three obstacles the narrator crossed/faced on the way into the woods.

Answer: Lunch is at noon; the show starts at 12:30 pm.

8. (Medium) Which listed activities explicitly ask for an RSVP and give an RSVP phone number? Give the event names and phone numbers.  
Answer: 
- Tiny Tots Fall for Nature — RSVP: 800/735-2258 (fee $3).  
- Musical Minds — RSVP: 410/266-0677.  
(Also Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature lists 800/735-2258 as the contact.)

9. (Medium) On which dates does the "All Aboard" event occur, and what time does it begin?  
Answer: October 9 & 10, at 2:00 pm.

10. (Medium) What are the age categories for the Nature Designs contest?  
Answer: 3–5, 6–8, and 9–12 years.

Hard
11. (Hard) Two events listed share identical times on the same day and the same park. Identify both events, the shared time, and the park. Why might a parent need to choose between them?  
Answer: 
- Events: "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" and "Spooky Stories in the Woods."  
- Shared time: 10:30 am–noon on Tuesday, Oct. 12.  
- Park: King's Landing Park, Huntingtown.  
A parent must choose because both events run at the same time and are at the same park, so a child cannot attend both simultaneously.

12. (Hard) The "Stone Soup" line begins with "October 9 (11:30am) - Enjoy lunch and a show." Later it says "Lunch is at noon; show starts at 12:30." Using the latter two explicit times, how many minutes elapse between the start of lunch and the start of the show? Show arithmetic.  
Answer: 12:30 − 12:00 = 30 minutes.

13. (Hard) Which phone number appears more than once in the listings, and for which items is it given?  
Answer: 800/735-2258 appears more than once. It is given for "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" (King's Landing Park, Huntingtown) and for "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature" (Battle Creek Cypress Swamp, Prince Frederick).

14. (Hard) Compose a single concise promotional sentence (maximum 35 words) that uses only facts and phrasing from the listings to promote the "Nature Designs" contest. (Your sentence must include the deadline date, the age categories, and at least one of the prizes.)  
Answer (example acceptable): "Nature Designs — Deadline Oct. 15: Create your favorite nature scene (ages 3–5, 6–8, 9–12) to win nature books or statues; bring entries to Wild Bird Center, Annapolis Harbour Center (410/573-0345)."  
(Any sentence that includes Oct. 15, categories 3–5/6–8/9–12, and mentions winners win nature books or statues, and references Wild Bird Center/phone, is correct.)

15. (Hard) From the masthead/header data, give the publication title, the date range shown, and the volume/issue identifiers exactly as printed.  
Answer: Publication: New Bay Times. Date range: October 7–13, 1999. Volume/issue: Volume VII Number 40 | Issue 40.

-------------------------
EXAM 2 — Logic / scheduling / deduction (puzzle style)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Which venue is given for "Stone Soup"? Provide the full line as printed (venue and location).  
Answer: Chesapeake Music Hall, Off Rt. 50 approaching the Bay Bridge: 410/406-0306.

2. (Easy) What is the start time for "Musical Minds" and how long does it last?  
Answer: 4:00–4:45 pm; it lasts 45 minutes.

3. (Easy) Which event explicitly mentions "peanut butter & jelly"?  
Answer: Stone Soup (lunch).

4. (Easy) Which event is explicitly aimed at ages "2–4"?  
Answer: Musical Minds.

5. (Easy) On which date is "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature"? Give date and time.  
Answer: Saturday, October 16 (10:00–10:30 am).

Medium
6. (Medium) Two different activities are listed at "Annapolis Harbour Center." Identify them.  
Answer: "All Aboard" at Zany Brainy, Annapolis Harbour Center; and "Nature Designs" entries are to be taken to Wild Bird Center, Annapolis Harbour Center.

7. (Medium) If a parent wants to attend "All Aboard" and then "Stone Soup" on October 9, can they attend both in full without overlap? "All Aboard" starts at 2 pm; "Stone Soup" has lunch at noon and the show at 12:30. Explain.  
Answer: Yes. "Stone Soup" lunch and show are around noon/12:30 and conclude well before 2 pm. "All Aboard" at 2 pm begins afterward, so a parent could attend both sequentially.

8. (Medium) Find the single listing that includes an explicit entry fee amount (not a price for an event per person like a ticket but a fee indicated as $X). State event and amount.  
Answer: Tiny Tots Fall for Nature — $3.

9. (Medium) Two separate Tiny Tots activities are listed. Give their distinct subtitles and locations.  
Answer: 
- "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature Tues. Oct 12 (10:30am-noon)" — King's Landing Park, Huntingtown.  
- "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature Sat. Oct 16 (10-10:30am)" — Battle Creek Cypress Swamp, Prince Frederick.

10. (Medium) Which event description includes both a food/drink mention and a ranger-led hike? Provide the event name.  
Answer: "Spooky Stories in the Woods" — it says "Hike with a ranger to a clearing in the woods. Listen to autumn stories and drink warm apple cider. Gather leaves to make a craft."

Hard
11. (Hard) Construct a feasible 4‑event afternoon itinerary for an adult with a 3–year-old on Oct. 13 that obeys times, age restrictions, and travel assumptions only within the printed listings (use only printed times/ages/events). Explain any assumptions.  
Answer (one valid itinerary and explanation):
- 4:00–4:45 pm — Attend "Musical Minds" (ages 2–4) at Chesapeake Children's Museum.  
Assumption: The adult and 3‑year‑old go only to the listed event that fits the age and time on Oct. 13; there are no other Oct. 13 events listed. (Therefore itinerary contains the single appropriate event; if travel from earlier/day events were desired, none are scheduled that day in the listings.)

12. (Hard) Identify every unique phone number provided in the listings and map each to the event(s) or location(s) it accompanies. Present the mapping.  
Answer:
- 410/406-0306 — Chesapeake Music Hall (Stone Soup).  
- 410/266-1447 — Zany Brainy, Annapolis Harbour Center (All Aboard).  
- 800/735-2258 — King's Landing Park events (Tiny Tots Fall for Nature) and Battle Creek Cypress Swamp (Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature).  
- 410/535-5327 — King's Landing Park contact for Spooky Stories in the Woods.  
- 410/266-0677 — Chesapeake Children's Museum (Musical Minds) rsvp.  
- 410/573-0345 — Wild Bird Center, Annapolis Harbour Center (Nature Designs drop-off).

13. (Hard) Two events list "bring a bag lunch." Name them and state any extra items requested to bring.  
Answer: 
- Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (Oct. 12) — "Bring a bag lunch to enjoy w/apple cider."  
- Spooky Stories in the Woods (Oct. 12) — "Bring a bag lunch."  
Extra item specified: apple cider to enjoy with the bag lunch is mentioned in the Tiny Tots listing.

14. (Hard) The leaf-hunting worksheet shows several short clues (e.g., "May grow nuts", "Good for sap & color"). From the text, the narrator explicitly lists three tree names she had leaves from. Produce a logically sound short paragraph (2–3 sentences) that connects those three tree names to any of the worksheet clues without inventing facts not in the text. (You may only state what the text allows.)  
Answer (sample acceptable): "The narrator had leaves analyzed from an oak, a beech, and a sweet gum tree. The worksheet includes clues such as 'May grow nuts' and 'Good for sap & color,' which are presented for the reader to match to their own finds; the narrator does not explicitly match those clues to her named trees in the text."  
(Full credit for any answer that mentions the three tree names and correctly states the text does not explicitly assign the worksheet clues to those trees.)

15. (Hard) Design a one-paragraph (3–5 sentences) safety note you would add to the leaf-hunt worksheet that references at least two hazards the narrator experienced and uses wording consistent with the text (do not add new hazards). Provide the final text.  
Answer (example acceptable): "Travel to the deep, dark woods in daylight only and watch your step—mud‑ridden streams can be slippery. Expect flying creatures near trails and be cautious of webs; webmakers may spin into your hair. Bring a companion and keep hands clean after handling leaves."  
(Answers must mention mud‑ridden stream and flying creatures and/or webmakers; minor wording variations acceptable.)

-------------------------
EXAM 3 — Close reading & language tasks
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Replace the phrase "I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze." with an equivalent sentence that keeps meaning but uses the passive voice.  
Answer: "I even had my hair spun into a shiny maze by webmakers."

2. (Easy) What imperative instruction does the narrator give to the reader at the end of the leaf-hunting section? (one short phrase)  
Answer: "Cut out the page and take it with you."

3. (Easy) Identify the three single-word headings (or short headings) that appear repeated at least once in the leaf-hunting worksheet area. (Hint: look for short phrases set off as clues.)  
Answer: Examples: "Narrow body with pointy edges" (repeated), plus other short clue lines such as "May grow berries", "May grow nuts", "Good for sap & color", "3 distinct leafs." (Any three of these count as headings/clues.)

4. (Easy) In one sentence, restate in your own words why the narrator claims "My luck was good that day."  
Answer: Because she found many different kinds of leaves on the ground, including some she had never seen and some in various stages of color change.

5. (Easy) Give the full title line that appears above the leaf-hunting worksheet (the short headline).  
Answer: "Not Just for Kids" (followed by the subheading "The Hunt for Falling Leaves... Nature's Color on the Ground by Mary Catherine Ball").

Medium
6. (Medium) The writer uses a question to engage the reader: "Have you ever hunted for leaves? I wonder if you know the names of five of the trees that live in your neighborhood? I bet the answer is no." Rewrite these two sentences as a single compound-complex sentence that retains the rhetorical effect.  
Answer (one acceptable rewrite): "Have you ever hunted for leaves, and although I wonder whether you can name five trees in your neighborhood, I bet you cannot."  
(Any grammatically correct compound-complex sentence preserving the meaning is acceptable.)

7. (Medium) Identify and correct the single obvious grammatical error in the list of leaf-clues (the worksheet): "3 distinct leafs" — provide the corrected phrase.  
Answer: "3 distinct leaves"

8. (Medium) The author uses short vivid items to list obstacles ("First, I crossed..., Then, I came face to face..., I even endured..."). Name the rhetorical device primarily in use and briefly define it.  
Answer: Parallelism — repeating similar grammatical structures (the sequence "I crossed..., I came..., I even endured...") to create rhythm and emphasis.

9. (Medium) Produce a concise (one-sentence) summary of the "Stone Soup" listing that includes: (a) the date, (b) what to eat, (c) show title, and (d) the performing group.  
Answer: On October 9 (11:30 am), eat peanut butter & jelly lunch at noon and then watch "Stone Soup" performed by the Lost Caravan (show at 12:30) at Chesapeake Music Hall.

10. (Medium) The editorial header shows navigation items printed as vertical pipes separated words, e.g., "| Homepage | | Back to Archives |". Recreate exactly how those two navigation labels appear in the text.  
Answer: "| Homepage |" and "| Back to Archives |"

Hard
11. (Hard) The leaf-hunt copy has several one-line clues. Produce a logically consistent taxonomy (a 5-line bulleted list) that orders those five clues by how easily a young child (ages 3–5) could use them to identify a leaf, from easiest to hardest. For each line give the clue and one-sentence justification.  
Answer (one acceptable ordering; sample):
- "May grow nuts" — easiest: children can relate nuts to trees and may have seen/acorn examples.  
- "May grow berries" — children often recognize berries by sight or touch.  
- "Narrow body with pointy edges" — a simple visual description children can match by shape.  
- "3 distinct leaves" — requires counting and noticing leaflet arrangement (slightly harder).  
- "Good for sap & color" — hardest: requires knowledge about sap usage and autumn coloration, less concrete for preschoolers.

12. (Hard) Rewrite the paragraph beginning "Being a reporter, I am always looking for an adventure..." into a single paragraph of no more than 40 words that preserves the sequence of events (stream, flying creatures, webs) and states the final purpose.  
Answer (sample acceptable): "As a reporter seeking adventure, I crossed a mud‑ridden stream, faced flying creatures vying for me, and endured webmakers spinning my hair, because I had gone into the woods to gather fallen leaves." (38 words.)

13. (Hard) Produce a short analytic sentence (one sentence, 20–30 words) that states the author's tone in the leaf-hunt narrative and cites one textual phrase that justifies your reading.  
Answer (sample): "The narrator’s tone is playful and adventurous, as shown by the phrase 'I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze,' which mixes peril with amusement." (Accept similar sentences that identify tone and cite that phrase.)

14. (Hard) The listings use varied punctuation for time ranges (e.g., "10:30am-noon", "4-4:45pm"). Create a consistent style rule (one sentence) you would apply to the listings, and then rewrite the "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" time entry to match your rule.  
Answer (example rule and rewrite): Rule: "Use a space between time and am/pm, use an en dash for ranges, and place times as 'hh:mm am–hh:mm pm'." Rewritten: "10:30 am–12:00 pm" (or "10:30 am–noon" if keeping 'noon' word).  
(Full credit if student proposes a clear consistent rule and applies it to give a corrected time.)

15. (Hard) Edit the following single-sentence listing into grammatically correct newspaper copy (one sentence): "All Aboard October 9 & 10 (2pm)-Chug a chug to Zany Brainy for train fun. Listen to stories and sing railroad songs. Build your own trains. Ages 3+." Provide the corrected single sentence.  
Answer (example): "All Aboard, October 9 & 10 at 2:00 pm — Chug to Zany Brainy (Annapolis Harbour Center) for train fun: listen to stories, sing railroad songs, and build your own trains (ages 3+)."  
(Any grammatically correct one-sentence consolidation is acceptable.)

EXAM 4 — Data extraction, arithmetic, and planning (practical tasks)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) How many separate event entries (distinct named events) are listed in the program block following the leaf-hunt page? Count them.  
Answer: Seven. (Listed events: Stone Soup; All Aboard; Tiny Tots Fall for Nature; Spooky Stories in the Woods; Musical Minds; Nature Designs; Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature.)

2. (Easy) Which event explicitly lists a monetary admission price for a child activity and what is that price?  
Answer: Musical Minds — $8.50 (fee).

3. (Easy) Which event has the shortest listed duration and what is that duration?  
Answer: "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature" — 10–10:30 am (30 minutes).

4. (Easy) What date range covers the publication issue?  
Answer: October 7–13, 1999.

5. (Easy) Name the park used as location for both Tiny Tots Fall for Nature and Spooky Stories in the Woods.  
Answer: King's Landing Park, Huntingtown.

Medium
6. (Medium) A family wants to attend every event that occurs on or after Oct. 12 (inclusive) and that lasts no longer than one hour. List which listed events they could attend and the total combined scheduled minutes (sum durations) based only on given times.  
Answer:
Events on/after Oct. 12 lasting ≤ 1 hour:
- Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (Oct 12, 10:30 am–noon) — 90 minutes (EXCEEDS 1 hour) => exclude.  
- Spooky Stories in the Woods (Oct 12, 10:30–noon) — 90 minutes => exclude.  
- Musical Minds (Oct 13, 4–4:45 pm) — 45 minutes => include.  
- Nature Designs (Deadline Oct 15) — not a timed event (no duration) => cannot include as a scheduled event.  
- Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature (Oct 16, 10–10:30 am) — 30 minutes => include.  
Total combined minutes: 45 + 30 = 75 minutes.  
(Explanation: Only Musical Minds and Tiny Tots get in Touch meet the ≤1 hour criterion and are on or after Oct 12.)

7. (Medium) If a caregiver plans to bring a 3-year-old to events only marked for "Ages 3–5" or "Ages 2–4", which listed events are appropriate?  
Answer: Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (ages 3–5) and Musical Minds (ages 2–4). Tiny Tots get in Touch is for "Tiny tots (2–3 w/adult)" — that would also be appropriate for a 3-year-old if the listing's lower/higher bounds are inclusive; therefore Tiny Tots get in Touch (2–3 with adult) may be borderline since it's exactly 3. If strict: include all three: Tiny Tots Fall for Nature; Musical Minds; Tiny Tots get in Touch (if 3 included).

8. (Medium) For the "Nature Designs" contest: if a child in the 6–8 category wins a place prize of a nature book, and the parent needs the Wild Bird Center phone number, what number should they call?  
Answer: 410/573-0345.

9. (Medium) Determine the weekday named in the Musical Minds listing and the specific festival/location name connected to it.  
Answer: Wednesday (Wed. Oct. 13) — Chesapeake Children's Museum, Festival at Riva.

Hard
10. (Hard) Create a single-day schedule for Oct. 12 for a parent who wants to (a) attend only events at King's Landing Park, (b) bring a bag lunch, and (c) participate in an activity that includes a ranger. Include times as given and total time spent there. Provide a one-sentence justification that this schedule follows the printed listings.  
Answer (schedule and justification):
- 10:30 am–noon — Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (hike into the woods, gather leaves, craft; bring a bag lunch to enjoy with apple cider).  
- 10:30 am–noon — (OR) Spooky Stories in the Woods (hike with a ranger to a clearing, listen to stories, drink warm apple cider, gather leaves; bring a bag lunch).  
Total time spent: 90 minutes.  
Justification: Both listed King's Landing Park activities on Oct. 12 are 10:30–noon; Spooky Stories explicitly mentions "Hike with a ranger," and Tiny Tots mentions "bring a bag lunch to enjoy w/apple cider," so choosing Spooky Stories meets the ranger criterion and either listing covers bag lunch/park criteria. (Note: the student must explain overlap and selection.)

11. (Hard) Compute the number of full days between the issue start date and the "Nature Designs" deadline (inclusive of the deadline date but exclusive of the issue start date). Show calculation. (Issue start date = Oct. 7, deadline = Oct. 15.)  
Answer: Inclusive of Oct. 15 but exclusive of Oct. 7: Oct. 8–Oct. 15 inclusive is 8 days. Calculation: Oct. 15 − Oct. 7 = 8 days.

12. (Hard) Using only the times/timespan info printed, is it possible to attend both "Stone Soup" show and the "All Aboard" program on Oct. 9 if they are held at different venues on the same day? Explain quantitatively (show time boundaries).  
Answer: Yes. "Stone Soup" has lunch at noon and the show at 12:30 (presumably ends before 2 pm), and "All Aboard" begins at 2 pm on Oct. 9. There is at least a 30-minute gap (12:30 show start; if the show is reasonably short or concludes before 2 pm) giving time to travel. Based solely on printed times there is no direct overlap; attendance is possible as long as travel time allows.

13. (Hard) Assume a parent attends Musical Minds with two children and pays the stated fee once per child. How much must they budget for entry? Show math.  
Answer: Musical Minds fee is $8.50 per person (implied). For two children: 2 × $8.50 = $17.00.

14. (Hard) Provide a short emergency instruction (1–2 sentences) that you could print on the leaf-hunt cut‑out advising children what to do if they encounter the hazards listed by the narrator (mud, flying creatures, webs). Use direct action verbs and keep it to two sentences.  
Answer (example): "Stay on dry ground when possible and avoid crossing deep mud; turn back and find a safer route. If flying insects swarm or you hit webs, cover your face and move calmly to a clear spot and call an adult."

15. (Hard) Create a minimal "packing list" (3–5 items) for a child going to the Tiny Tots Fall for Nature activity, using only items or suggestions explicitly mentioned or implied in the text. For each item give a one-line reason tied to the listing.  
Answer (sample):
- Bag lunch — "Bring a bag lunch to enjoy w/apple cider."  
- Adult companion — the event is for "Three- to five-year-olds (and their adult)."  
- Small bag for leaves/craft supplies — "gather leaves and make a craft."  
- Weather-appropriate shoes — to cross mud-ridden streams and hike in woods (implied by terrain described).

-------------------------
EXAM 5 — Creative / synthesis / critique (higher-order)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Give the byline (author name) exactly as printed for the leaf-hunt article.  
Answer: Mary Catherine Ball.

2. (Easy) Quote the three-word phrase that introduces the page’s theme: "The Hunt for Falling Leaves..." (use exact punctuation).  
Answer: "The Hunt for Falling Leaves..."

3. (Easy) Which phrase indicates that the leaf-hunt page is intended for readers older than children as well? (one short phrase from the heading)  
Answer: "Not Just for Kids"

4. (Easy) Which city/bridge landmark is used in the Stone Soup location line?  
Answer: The Bay Bridge (Off Rt. 50 approaching the Bay Bridge).

5. (Easy) Which event specifically mentions "Build your own trains"?  
Answer: All Aboard (Zany Brainy).

Medium
6. (Medium) Draft a two-sentence subheading (to place under "Not Just for Kids") that entices adult readers to join the leaf hunt, using only facts or phrases present in the text.  
Answer (sample acceptable): "Travel to the deep, dark woods in daylight to gather fallen leaves—some still green, some changing to autumn colors. Cut out the page, match your discoveries with mine, and enjoy a nature adventure."  
(Any two-sentence subheading that uses only supplied facts/phrases is acceptable.)

7. (Medium) Prepare three bullet-point reviewer comments (each 10–15 words) critiquing the clarity or usefulness of the leaf-hunt worksheet for a family group. Reference text specifics.  
Answer (sample):
- "Clear invitation, but worksheet omits exact tree names for several clues—confusing for novices."  
- "Good safety omission: 'Travel in daylight' is stated, but no clothing advice provided."  
- "Repeat clue builds emphasis (two 'Narrow body…') but could confuse which leaves to find."

8. (Medium) Rewrite the listing header "Stone Soup October 9 (11:30am)-Enjoy lunch and a show." into a compact, newspaper-style heading followed by a one-line subtext. (two-line answer).  
Answer (example):  
Stone Soup — Oct. 9 (11:30 am)  
Lunch at noon (peanut butter & jelly); show "Stone Soup" at 12:30, performed by the Lost Caravan.  
(Any equivalent two-line reformulation acceptable.)

9. (Medium) Produce a three-step family safety checklist (each step one short sentence) for a leaf-hunt based on the narrator’s experience. Use no new hazards.  
Answer (example):
- Go into the woods only in daylight and stay on clear paths to avoid mud‑ridden streams.  
- Move calmly if flying creatures approach and keep faces protected from insects.  
- Watch for spider webs and, if tangled, gently clear hair and seek an adult's help.

10. (Medium) Evaluate whether the phrase "My luck was good that day." is primarily factual or subjective in the context. Give a one-sentence justification with a short quoted example from the text.  
Answer: Subjective — it expresses the narrator’s personal feeling because it follows an account of events ("I was able to spy lots of different kinds of leaves lying on the ground") rather than being an objective measurement.

Hard
11. (Hard) Create a 4‑sentence promotional blurb (suitable for a parenting newsletter) that links one of the listed events to the leaf-hunt activity (you must not invent new facts; you may combine facts from two separate listings). Clearly indicate which two activities you combined.  
Answer (sample acceptable):  
Combined events: "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" (Oct. 12) and the leaf-hunt invitation.  
Blurb: "Bring your three- to five-year-old to King's Landing Park on Oct. 12 for Tiny Tots Fall for Nature. Hike into the woods, gather fallen leaves and make a craft together. Cut out the leaf-hunt page and match your finds with the suggested clues. Enjoy your bag lunch with apple cider while the kids explore."  
(Any 4-sentence blurb that uses only information from the two listings and references the cut‑out page receives full credit.)

12. (Hard) The piece alternates short, punchy sentences with longer descriptive ones. Identify two examples of each from the leaf-hunt narrative and explain (one sentence) how this rhythm affects reader engagement.  
Answer (sample):  
Short examples: "Being a reporter, I am always looking for an adventure." "Where did I go?"  
Long examples: "First, I crossed a mud-ridden stream. Then, I came face to face with flying creatures, fighting to get near me. I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze." (counted as longer descriptive line)  
Effect explanation: The alternation creates momentum and suspense—short lines pose questions or set tone, while longer descriptions immerse the reader in sensory detail.

13. (Hard) Produce a brief (2–3 sentence) critique focused on the accessibility of the phone/contact information as printed (layout/duplication/clarity). Include one concrete suggestion for improvement derived from the text.  
Answer (sample): "The listings include multiple phone numbers but some are repeated (800/735-2258 appears twice) and others lack labels, which may confuse readers. Suggestion: print each phone number next to a clear event label and include an email/website field for alternate contact."  
(Any critique noting duplication/confusion and giving a concrete suggestion suffices.)

14. (Hard) Draft an alternate closing line for the leaf-hunt page (one sentence) that preserves the tone and invites participation, using at least two words/phrases that appear in the original text.  
Answer (example): "Happy leaf‑hunting — travel to the deep, dark woods in daylight, cut out this page, and match your discovery with mine."  
(Should include phrases such as "deep, dark woods", "cut out the page", "match your discovery", or "Happy leaf-hunting".)

15. (Hard) Imagine you're preparing an accessibility note for visually impaired families who want to participate in the leaf hunt. In two sentences, indicate which two elements from the printed materials you would convert to audio and why, referencing content from the text.  
Answer (sample): "Provide an audio narration of the leaf-clue worksheet (the lines like 'Narrow body with pointy edges' and 'May grow nuts') so families can identify leaves by listening rather than reading. Also record the event details (dates/times/locations and RSVP numbers) so caregivers can plan attendance without needing printed listings."  
(Full credit for any two reasonable elements drawn from the listings with clear reasons.)

End of exams. If you want any exam adjusted (different difficulty balance, different format such as multiple-choice only, or answer sheets separated), tell me which one and I will revise.

### Active Reading
# Active Reading Interleaving: "Not Just for Kids — The Hunt for Falling Leaves..."  
Below I preview the piece, set a purpose, activate prior knowledge, then read the document with my thoughts, questions, annotations, and short summaries inserted as if I'm writing in the margins. At the end I summarize, review, pose questions, and note how I might use this.

---

## Before Reading (Preview / Purpose / Prior knowledge)
- Preview: Headings: "Not Just for Kids", "The Hunt for Falling Leaves...", "Nature's Color on the Ground", by Mary Catherine Ball. Looks like a short narrative + a leaf-hunting activity + local event listings.  
- Purpose: I want to understand the leaf-hunting activity, identify the five leaves described, and note any practical instructions for doing the activity. Also curious about the local events at the end.  
- Activate prior knowledge: I know autumn leaves change color, common trees include oak, beech, sweet gum, maple; some trees make nuts or berries; sweet gum has star-shaped (palmate) leaves; beech has smooth edges; oak often lobed; pay attention to descriptive clues.

## During Reading — Interleaved document with annotations

Title: Not Just for Kids  
> Reader's note: Title suggests content suitable for all ages—likely an activity that appeals beyond children.

Subtitle: The Hunt for Falling Leaves...  
> Question to self: Is this a personal story or an activity guide? Expect both.

Subtitle: Nature's Color on the Ground  
> Prediction: The piece will describe colors and perhaps explain why leaves change.

by Mary Catherine Ball  
> Note: Author named — likely a newspaper or magazine feature.

Paragraph:
Being a reporter, I am always looking for an adventure. Last week, I found one.  
> Annotation: Opening sets a personal, first-person tone — expect narrative and discovery.  
> Thought: “Adventure” for a reporter = investigating everyday things; makes the leaf hunt feel lively.

Paragraph:
I left work to go on a simple journey, but it turned out to be much more.  
> Margin: Sets up curiosity — what made it more than simple?

Paragraph:
First, I crossed a mud-ridden stream. Then, I came face to face with flying creatures, fighting to get near me. I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze.  
> Annotate: Sensory details: mud, insects (flying creatures), spiders (webmakers). Visualize the walk — wet ground, buzzing insects, sticky spider webs.  
> Question: "Flying creatures" — bees? gnats? Could be mosquitoes in the woods. "Webmakers" = spiders — adds humor.

Paragraph:
Where did I go? Into the woods, of course. Why? I wanted to gather some fallen leaves.  
> Think: Clear purpose: leaf collecting. Good simple activity; watch for safety tips (daylight, where to go).

Paragraph:
My luck was good that day. I was able to spy lots of different kinds of leaves lying on the ground. Some were leaves I had never seen. Some were still green, while others were changing to their autumn colors.  
> Annotation: Key idea — diversity of leaves, different stages of color change.  
> Question: Will she identify them? Yes — she later mentions having them analyzed.

Paragraph:
Have you ever hunted for leaves? I wonder if you know the names of five of the trees that live in your neighborhood? I bet the answer is no.  
> Reader reaction: Engaging question — draws me in. I should try to name five trees near me (oak, maple, pine, birch, sweet gum?).

Paragraph:
Well, me neither. So I had five of the leaves analyzed. I had found the leaves from an oak, a beech, a sweet gum tree and more.  
> Note: She lists oak, beech, sweet gum, and implies at least two more species (since she said five). Keep an eye out for clues to identify the other two.  
> Quick thought: "and more" — odd phrasing; we'll find descriptions below.

Line(s) (looks like leaf-identification clues presented as a checklist or cut-out activity):
Narrow body with pointy edges  
Narrow body with pointy edges  
May grow berries  
Good for sap & color  
3 distinct leafs  
May grow nuts

> Annotated reading for each clue:
- "Narrow body with pointy edges" (appears twice)  
  - Thought: Could be two different species that share this trait (e.g., willow has narrow pointy leaves; hornbeam? but hornbeam leaves are serrated). Narrow + pointy could be birch or willow or maybe some kinds of oak (not typical). Two similar leaves — maybe different sizes (young vs. mature).  
  - Question: Why repeated? Possibly two different trees with narrow pointed leaves (e.g., birch and beech? but beech leaves are not narrow). Keep evidence from earlier: she mentioned oak, beech, sweet gum + more. Beech leaves are oval with serrated edges, not narrow.  

- "May grow berries"  
  - Thought: Trees/shrubs that produce berries: dogwood, holly, serviceberry, hawthorn. Look for red berries in fall (dogwood and holly common). Could be referring to a tree common in the author's area.  
  - Question: Does "berries" refer to true berries or berry-like fruits (e.g., holly)?

- "Good for sap & color"  
  - Annotation: That strongly suggests maple — sap for syrup, fall color is notable. So one leaf likely from a maple (good for sap & color = maple).

- "3 distinct leafs"  
  - Note: "3 distinct leafs" probably means leaf with three (or three-lobed) leaflets or three distinct points. Could be a sweet gum? Sweet gum actually has star-shaped leaves with 5 pointed lobes typically. "3 distinct leafs" might mean trifoliate leaf — e.g., poison sumac? Or "3 distinct leafs" could mean three separate leaflets like redbud?  
  - But earlier she explicitly mentioned "sweet gum" among the identified leaves. Sweet gum has star-shaped leaves (5 pointed lobes), which might be described as "distinct". Another species with three leaflets: poison ivy (3), but that's not likely a featured friendly example. Maybe "3 distinct leafs" refers to the sweet gum if the number is approximate. Keep an open mind.

- "May grow nuts"  
  - Annotation: Nuts suggests oak (acorns), beech (beech nuts), hickory (pecans), chestnut, or walnut. She already named oak and beech — one of these clues likely corresponds to the beech or oak.

Overall note: The clues are a little ambiguous; later text invites readers to find 5 leaves and cut out the page to take it into the woods — so these are probably meant as simple ID prompts for kids.

Paragraph:
This is your task...  
Travel to the deep, dark woods (in the daylight) to find these 5 leaves. Cut out the page and take it with you. Make sure you can match your discovery with mine. Happy leaf-hunting!  
> Margin: Practical instruction: go in daylight, take page. Safety tip implied (daylight).  
> Question: They say "deep, dark woods" but parenthetical "in the daylight" — good reminder. Also, "cut out the page" indicates the sheet was once part of a print where kids could take the checklist.

## During Reading — Specific identification attempt (thinking through the clues)
I want to match the clues to tree types. Using earlier explicit names and the clues:

- Known from text: oak, beech, sweet gum + more (two unspecified).
- Clue mapping possibilities:
  - "Good for sap & color" → Maple (sap for syrup, strong fall color)
  - "May grow nuts" → Oak or Beech (both can produce nuts; oak = acorns, beech = beechnuts). Since oak already named, this clue might point to oak or beech; but because the text named both, one clue for "may grow nuts" maps to oak and another leaf clue might indicate beech (beech has smoother, oval leaves with small teeth).
  - "3 distinct leafs" → Could point to sweet gum (star-shaped with distinct lobes) or a trifoliate species. Sweet gum usually has 5 pointed lobes, though people might describe it as having distinct points. The author explicitly named sweet gum — so "3 distinct leafs" may be a simplified kid-friendly description for the star shape (but 3 is inaccurate). Another candidate: Horse chestnut has palmate leaves (5-7 leaflets), poison ivy has 3 — but they'd avoid encouraging kids to pick poison ivy.  
  - "May grow berries" → Dogwood or holly or holly-like shrubs often have berries in fall; a "may grow berries" tree is likely dogwood (beautiful fall color too).

Reader's working hypothesis (based on text + typical local trees):
- Oak — “may grow nuts” (acorns)
- Beech — smooth-ish oval leaves with toothed margin
- Sweet gum — star-shaped (distinct lobes)
- Maple — “good for sap & color”
- Dogwood or holly-like tree — “may grow berries”
- "Narrow body with pointy edges" (two items) — possibly birch and willow or two species of oak? But repeating the clue twice in the original suggests two different narrow leaves — perhaps willow and something else (e.g., cherry has narrow leaves with serrated edges). Because the text earlier named only oak, beech, sweet gum and "more", one of the narrow ones may be the beech (but beech isn't narrow), so there's ambiguity.

Conclusion: The printed clues are simplified and slightly ambiguous. The main point is to get readers into the woods to observe and compare.

## After Reading — Reflection, Summary, Review, Questions, Application

1. Summary of main ideas (without looking back):  
- The author, a reporter, went into the woods to collect fallen leaves. She found many kinds and had five analyzed (oak, beech, sweet gum and two others). The page includes a cut-out activity prompting readers to go leaf-hunting (in daylight) and match five described leaves. The rest of the page lists local family events in mid-October 1999 related to nature, music, and crafts.

2. Review of annotations / key takeaways:  
- Tone: personal, playful, encourages exploration.  
- Safety: go in daylight; implied adult supervision for kids.  
- Practical: collect leaves, compare shapes and features (narrow vs. lobed vs. serrated), look for berries or nuts, note sap-producing species (maples).  
- Community tie-ins: many local programs encourage the same exploration (leaf crafts, ranger-led hikes).

3. Connections to other knowledge or experience:  
- Reminds me of school autumn nature walks and leaf identification guides. The activity can easily be adapted into a simple science lesson: classify leaves by shape, margin, venation, and fruit.

4. Questions I still have / things I'd ask the author:  
- Which two species exactly were the remaining leaves (the ones not named)?  
- Why are two "Narrow body with pointy edges" clues repeated — are they different species or a printing error?  
- Can the author provide simple silhouette sketches next to each clue (would make ID easier)?  
- Any tips for preserving leaves for a craft (pressing, drying)?

5. Reflection on application — how I might use this information:  
- Use the cut-out checklist and go on a guided leaf-hunt with kids or a community group.  
- Make a simple ID key: match "Good for sap" → Maple; "May grow nuts" → Oak/Beech; "3 distinct leafs/star shape" → Sweet Gum; "May grow berries" → Dogwood/Holly; "Narrow body with pointy edges" → Birch/Willow/Cherry.  
- For a lesson: have children collect one example of each, draw the leaf, note its size, color, and any fruit, and press them for a display.

6. Quick action checklist if I were to lead this activity:
- Bring the cut-out page or a printed checklist.  
- Go during daylight and wear appropriate shoes/clothing.  
- Bring bags for leaves, a field guide or phone app for ID, and hand sanitizer.  
- Teach safety: avoid poison ivy (leaves of three), don't eat any berries/nuts without adult confirmation.  
- After collecting, sort leaves by shape, color, and margin; try to identify with the clues.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a cleaned, kid-friendly ID key mapping likely species to each clue, or  
- Turn the ambiguous clues into clearer descriptions and add simple drawings or silhouette shapes for each leaf (text-only descriptions if you prefer), or  
- Create a printable one-page leaf-hunt checklist based on this text. Which would you like?
