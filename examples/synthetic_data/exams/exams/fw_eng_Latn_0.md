6. M1 — Short answer: According to the text, how did Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Darcy initially come across, and what did it show about her?

7. M2 — Quotation identification: Provide the two-word phrase the author uses to describe the way Jane “screams” her outrage at limitations for women in Emma.

8. M3 — Explain briefly: In the exchange with Mrs. Elton, what distinction does Jane Fairfax draw between the “slave-trade” and the “governess-trade”?

Hard (5)
11. H1 — Analytical short essay (approx. 120–150 words): Summarize and evaluate the author’s main argumentative move when comparing Jane Austen and Thomas Jefferson. In your answer, state the thesis and two supporting points the author uses.
    Answer: Thesis: Jane Austen’s impact on freedom and independence is no less important than Jefferson’s. Supporting points: (1) Austen’s writing advocates independence of person and thought and promotes rights and responsibility quietly rather than by violent revolution. (2) While Jefferson’s words instigated war and political change, Austen’s influence is subtler and cultural—she declared and promoted principles similar to Jefferson’s (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness) through literature and social critique. Evaluation: The author argues by analogy—both advanced ideals of independence, though in different spheres and with different methods. The move highlights the moral and cultural influence of literature, but rests on broad equivalence rather than empirical measure of influence. It persuasively reframes Austen’s work as politically expressive, though the comparison risks oversimplifying the different natures and effects of political versus literary action.

12. H2 — Close analysis: Identify and explain the rhetorical effect of the parenthetical aside “not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.” How does it function within the passage quoted?
    Answer: The aside draws a stark comparison between literal slavery and the professional commodification of women’s minds. It uses contrast to shock the reader and to emphasize that selling intellectual labor is akin to selling the person. It also undercuts Mrs. Elton’s trivializing response; the phrase forces readers to consider moral gravity and social irony, heightening sympathy for governesses and critiquing social norms.

13. H3 — Synthesis: List three specific textual examples the author uses to argue Austen champions independence, and explain in one sentence how each example supports the claim.
    Answer: (1) Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins — shows independence of thought by rejecting a socially advantageous marriage. (2) Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Darcy (initially) — demonstrates moral autonomy and resistance to social pressure. (3) Jane Fairfax’s governess-trade remark — exposes structural limitations on women and asserts intellectual agency. Each example illustrates characters resisting social expectation and valuing personal choice.

14. H4 — Interpretation: The author calls Austen an “avowed royalist” but also believes she “firmly believed in [Jefferson’s] declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” What tension does the author imply here and how is it resolved?
    Answer: Tension: Royalism implies loyalty to monarchy and the status quo, while Jeffersonian rights imply revolutionary individual liberties. Resolution: The author suggests Austen reconciles this by promoting personal and social freedoms within her genteel, non-revolutionary context—advocating liberty through literature and moral persuasion rather than political upheaval.

15. H5 — Comparative rhetorical assessment: The author contrasts Jefferson’s “excessive consequence” with Jane’s “quiet, genteel yet powerful way.” Analyze the-choice of adjectives and tone here: what argument is being made about modes of influence, and what implicit value judgment is present?
    Answer: The adjectives contrast overt, large-scale political action (“excessive consequence,” revolution, war) with subtle cultural influence (“quiet, genteel yet powerful”). The argument: both modes effect fundamental change—Jefferson through forceful public action, Austen through moral-cultural persuasion. Implicit value judgment: the author values Austen’s gentler influence and sees it as morally significant and perhaps preferable or at least equally commendable; describing Jefferson’s consequences as “excessive” suggests ambivalence toward violent change.

8. M3 — Short analysis: Why does the author mention John Adams leaving his farm in mid-December 1775? Give the purpose in one sentence.

Hard (5)
11. H1 — Close textual proof: Cite (quote) the exact sentence that directly compares Austen’s impact to Jefferson’s.
    Answer: “Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s.”

12. H2 — Critical task: Identify one potential objection a careful reader might raise to the author’s claim that Austen’s impact is “no less important than Jefferson’s,” and compose a one-paragraph rebuttal that the author might offer using language or concepts from the passage.
    Answer: Objection: Jefferson’s political actions led to a revolution and concrete changes in government, while Austen’s literary influence produced no comparable political outcomes. Rebuttal (one paragraph using passage concepts): The author might reply that importance is not measured solely by visible political upheaval; Austen’s subtle influence shaped social ideas about freedom and independence—advocating rights and personal responsibility through characters and moral argument. Though lacking the “excessive consequence” of war, her “quiet, genteel yet powerful way” instigated cultural shifts that support the same principles Jefferson espoused: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

13. H3 — Rhetorical identification: Name two rhetorical strategies the author uses to elevate Austen’s status and briefly explain their effect.
    Answer: (1) Analogy/comparison to founding figures (Jefferson, Adams) — elevates Austen by association with canonical political actors. (2) Juxtaposition of “quiet” influence versus “excessive” political consequence — reframes literary influence as equally valid and morally weighty, making the reader reassess assumptions about power.

14. H4 — Inference: Based solely on the passage, would the author likely agree with this statement — “Austen supports violent revolution to secure liberty”? Explain your answer in one sentence.
    Answer: No; the author stresses Austen did not incite military action and promoted independence in a genteel, nonviolent fashion.

15. H5 — Synthesis/creation: Using no more than two sentences, compose a single topical thesis sentence that would serve as the opening of an essay defending the passage’s principal claim.
    Answer: Jane Austen’s novels, though lacking in overt political theatre, function as powerful engines of social liberty—championing personal autonomy, intellectual agency, and the ethical responsibilities of freedom—and thus deserve recognition comparable to canonical political declarations of independence.
