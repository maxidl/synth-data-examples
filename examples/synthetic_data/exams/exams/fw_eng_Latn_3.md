Exam 1 — Objective and short-answer test
(Instructions: Answer all questions. Use only information provided by the research description.)

Easy (5)
1. Multiple choice: What is the main function of the new membrane?
   A) Generate electricity from seawater
   B) Filter water via reverse osmosis while resisting clogging
   C) Convert seawater to hydrogen fuel
   D) Increase salt concentration in seawater  
   Solution: B

2. Multiple choice: Which surface treatment enabled large-scale, non-vacuum processing?
   A) High-temperature annealing
   B) Chemical etching
   C) Atmospheric pressure plasma
   D) Ultraviolet irradiation  
   Solution: C

3. Short answer: Name the three overall steps used to synthesize the membrane.
   Solution: (1) Synthesize a polyamide thin-film composite membrane via interfacial polymerization; (2) activate the polyamide surface with atmospheric pressure plasma to create active sites; (3) initiate graft polymerization with a monomer solution to create a polymer brush layer.

4. Multiple choice: The polymer brush layer is tethered (chemically anchored). One immediate consequence stated is:
   A) It dissolves in water
   B) It is less thermally stable than physical coatings
   C) It is more thermally stable than physically coated polymer films
   D) It requires vacuum to remain stable  
   Solution: C

5. Short answer: Give two mechanisms by which the brush layer reduces fouling.
   Solution: (1) Constant motion of polymer chains prevents bacteria/colloids from anchoring; (2) the surface charge of the brush layer can be chosen to electrostatically repel oppositely charged foulants.

Medium (5)
6. Short answer: Explain why atmospheric pressure plasma is preferable to earlier plasma treatments for commercialization of long membrane rolls.
   Solution: Earlier plasma treatment required vacuum chambers, impractical and costly for thousands of meters of membrane; atmospheric pressure plasma allows treating surfaces without vacuum, like "brushing" the surface, making it compatible with continuous large-scale production.

7. Short answer: What performance characteristics did the researchers report for the new membrane besides anti-scaling?
   Solution: High water permeability, high rejection characteristics (i.e., effective salt/impurity rejection), and long-term stability.

8. Short answer: The graft polymerization stage is controlled by two parameters mentioned. What are they, and why are they important?
   Solution: Time (reaction period) and temperature. They control brush layer thickness and topography, which affect anti-fouling performance and permeability.

9. Multiple choice: Which collaborators or centers were explicitly mentioned as working with the research team?
   A) UCLA WaTeR Center and industry/water agencies
   B) NASA and the Department of Energy
   C) WHO and UNICEF
   D) NOAA and EPA  
   Solution: A

10. Short answer: State one near-term goal the team plans with respect to membrane development.
    Solution: Expand membrane synthesis into a larger, continuous process and optimize membrane performance (surface properties/brush layers) for different water sources to create a membrane selection system.

Hard (5)
11. Analytical short answer: Describe, in mechanistic terms based on the text, why a moving polymer brush layer reduces the probability of bacterial attachment compared with a static smooth membrane surface.
    Solution: Bacterial/protein adhesion requires establishing multiple contact points to resist shear and stay attached. Tethered polymer chains are constantly moving and present a dynamic, uneven topography; flow-induced motion of the chains makes it difficult for a bacterium to form stable multiple anchor points, while the polymer chains also physically screen the underlying surface. This reduces adhesion energy and attachment probability.

12. Critical reasoning: The text claims the brush layer can impart surface charge to repel molecules of opposite charge. Explain how this feature could be used to reduce fouling in brackish water (which has mixed ions and organic matter). What trade-offs or complications might arise?
    Solution: Imparting a net negative (or positive) charge can electrostatically repel similarly charged colloids/proteins, reducing adhesion of charged foulants. For brackish water with mixed ions, selecting a charge that repels the predominant foulants reduces fouling. Trade-offs: charged surfaces may attract counter-ions (screening) or encourage scaling by opposite-charged mineral ions; changing charge could affect salt rejection or interaction with cleaning chemistries; the heterogeneous nature of real waters means a single charge may not repel all foulants.

13. Design/analysis: Propose two measurable performance metrics (with brief justification) you would monitor in a field trial to assess whether membranes with brush layers truly reduce operational costs compared to commercial membranes.
    Solution: (1) Flux decline rate over time (L/m2·h decline per day) — shows fouling rate and cleaning frequency requirement. (2) Frequency and severity of required chemical cleanings and membrane replacements (costs and downtime) — directly tied to operational cost. Additional useful metrics: salt rejection efficiency and energy consumption (pump pressure vs. throughput).

14. Calculation/estimate (conceptual): Suppose a membrane system needs less frequent chemical cleaning due to brush-layer membranes. Describe qualitatively how reduced cleaning frequency translates into lower cost components (list at least three) and which of those would be most immediately observable on operational logs.
    Solution: Reduced cleaning frequency lowers (1) chemical costs for cleaning agents, (2) labor and downtime costs for performing cleaning, (3) wear-and-tear/membrane replacement costs, (4) energy/time losses due to offline sections. Most immediately observable: fewer cleaning events logged and reduced chemical procurement/usage records.

15. Synthesis: The researchers claim that structuring the surface "does not require a long reaction time, high reaction temperature or the use of a vacuum chamber." Explain why each of those three absences is advantageous for industrial adoption.
    Solution: No long reaction time increases throughput and reduces manufacturing time per unit; no high temperatures reduce energy cost and risk of thermal damage to substrates; no vacuum chamber eliminates costly infrastructure and scale limitations, enabling continuous roll-to-roll processing and lower capital expenditure.

Exam 2 — Applied engineering and design
(Instructions: Use reasoning strictly based on the described research. Show brief justifications.)

Easy (5)
1. Short answer: List the three main layers/components formed on the membrane from base to outermost after full synthesis.
   Solution: Base substrate (support layer) — polyamide thin-film composite membrane — tethered polymer brush layer (outermost).

2. Multiple choice: Which process produces the initial polyamide thin-film composite membrane?
   A) Electrospinning
   B) Interfacial polymerization
   C) Plasma polymerization
   D) Thermal lamination  
   Solution: B

3. Short answer: Give one advantage of chemically anchored brush chains over physically coated polymer films mentioned in the text.
   Solution: Chemically anchored chains are more thermally stable.

4. Short answer: What environmental or operational challenge does the new membrane specifically aim to reduce in desalination plants?
   Solution: Scaling and fouling (clogging), which increase pumping energy demands and necessitate costly cleaning/replacement.

5. Short answer: State one way water flow interacts with the brush layer to produce anti-fouling effects.
   Solution: Water flow induces movement of polymer chains, increasing dynamic motion that prevents particle/bacterial anchoring.

Medium (5)
6. Process design: Sketch (describe in words) a continuous roll-to-roll production step incorporating atmospheric pressure plasma treatment between interfacial polymerization and graft polymerization. Identify at least three process control variables that must be monitored.
   Solution: Description: After interfacial polymerization producing polyamide on a rolled substrate, the roll passes under an atmospheric pressure plasma array that scans/“brushes” the surface to create active sites; immediately downstream the activated strip is exposed to a controlled monomer solution (e.g., via a coatingor spraying station) and then conveyed through a temperature-controlled zone for graft polymerization for a set time before curing and rewinding. Control variables: plasma power/intensity and scan speed (dose), exposure time to monomer (residence time), temperature of graft polymerization zone, monomer concentration, roll speed/tension.

7. Short answer: Why is control of brush layer thickness and topography important for membrane performance?
   Solution: Thickness and topography balance permeability (thicker/denser brushes may impede water flux) and antifouling (adequate thickness/mobility needed to block adhesion). Precise control ensures high water permeability while maintaining anti-scaling properties.

8. Short answer: Identify two categories of foulants that the membrane aims to reject or resist.
   Solution: Mineral salt ions (scaling) and biological/colloidal matter (bacteria, proteins, colloids).

9. Short answer: The team plans to create a "membrane selection system" for different water sources. List two input parameters that such a selection system should consider.
   Solution: (1) Fouling tendencies of the water (types/concentrations of foulants — mineral content, organic load, microbial load). (2) Water salinity and ionic composition; also operational parameters like required flux and allowable cleaning frequency.

10. Short answer: Name one immediate experimental advantage of using atmospheric pressure plasma as described.
    Solution: It allows treating almost any surface without vacuum, facilitating scalable continuous processing.

Hard (5)
11. Quantitative conceptual design: Suppose you are to design the graft polymerization zone in a continuous process where residence time t and temperature T jointly determine brush thickness h by the simplified relation h = k · t^α · exp(βT), where k, α, β are constants determined experimentally. Explain how you would experimentally determine k, α, β using only batch reactors and what key measurements you would take.
    Solution: Run a set of controlled graft polymerizations in batch reactors varying t and T systematically (e.g., t values at fixed T to get h vs t, and T values at fixed t to get h vs T). Measure resulting brush thickness h (e.g., ellipsometry or AFM) for each condition. Fit data to ln(h) = ln(k) + α ln(t) + βT (if exp(βT) with T in appropriate units) or transform appropriately and perform multivariate regression to extract ln(k), α, β. Ensure coverage of parameter space to avoid collinearity.

12. Experimental planning: Design a controlled lab experiment to demonstrate that the brush layer's motion (not just its presence) contributes to anti-fouling. Describe control samples, measurable outcome, and expected result that supports the claim.
    Solution: Prepare three membrane samples: (A) untreated polyamide (no brush), (B) polyamide with tethered brush layer but immobilized (e.g., crosslinked to restrict motion), (C) polyamide with normal tethered mobile brush layer. Expose all to a flowing suspension of fluorescently labeled bacteria under identical shear. Measure adhered bacteria density after set time via fluorescence microscopy and quantify detachment under increased shear. Expected: A high adhesion in A, intermediate in B, and lowest in C, demonstrating motion contributes beyond mere physical presence. Additional controls: same chemistry for B and C to isolate motion effect.

13. Troubleshooting: In scale-up you observe that membranes made at higher line speed have patches with inadequate brush coverage. List three likely causes related to plasma treatment and suggest remediation for each.
    Solution: (1) Insufficient plasma dose due to too-fast scanning — slow line speed or increase plasma power; (2) uneven plasma uniformity across width — adjust electrode geometry, use multiple plasma heads, or optimize head-to-surface distance; (3) inadequate residence time between activation and monomer application causing rapid deactivation of active sites — reduce delay, add inert atmosphere/enclosurization, or locally store activated surface under suitable conditions.

14. Cost-benefit analysis (short essay, ~4–6 sentences): Argue quantitatively (conceptual, not numerical) why increased membrane life and decreased chemical cleaning can reduce overall desalination costs even if the membrane unit cost is moderately higher. Mention at least three cost categories affected.
    Solution: Higher upfront membrane cost is amortized over a longer lifespan, reducing replacement frequency and capital expenditure per unit volume treated. Reduced chemical cleaning lowers recurring costs for cleaning agents and disposal, and reduces labor and downtime—improving plant throughput and reducing effective unit energy cost per m3. Less frequent cleaning also reduces membrane wear, further saving replacement costs. Additionally, lower fouling reduces required pumping energy (lower pressure/less frequent pressure increases), reducing operational energy expense. Combined, these recurring savings typically outweigh a moderate increase in initial membrane price.

Exam 3 — Data interpretation and critical analysis
(Instructions: Data below are hypothetical but consistent with the described membrane behavior. Use the given numbers to answer questions.)

Easy (5)
Given dataset (hypothetical): Two membrane types tested in identical RO modules under the same feed water: Commercial membrane (C) and Brush-layer membrane (B). Initial flux = 50 L/m2·h for both. After 30 days continuous operation:
- Flux for C = 30 L/m2·h
- Flux for B = 44 L/m2·h

1. Calculation: Compute percent flux decline for each membrane.
   Solution: C: decline = (50-30)/50 = 20/50 = 40%. B: decline = (50-44)/50 = 6/50 = 12%.

2. Short answer: Which membrane shows better fouling resistance and why?
   Solution: B shows better fouling resistance because its flux decline (12%) is much smaller than C's (40%), indicating less fouling.

3. Multiple choice: If cleaning restores flux to 95% of initial for both membranes, what will be flux after cleaning for C?
   A) 47.5 L/m2·h
   B) 45 L/m2·h
   C) 50 L/m2·h
   D) 30 L/m2·h  
   Solution: A (95% of 50 = 47.5)

4. Short answer: If membrane B requires cleaning once every 90 days and C every 30 days, how many cleanings per year for each?
   Solution: B: 365/90 ≈ 4 cleanings/year (actually 4.05 → 4). C: 365/30 ≈ 12 cleanings/year.

5. Short answer: List two operational metrics that these simple numbers (flux decline and cleaning frequency) directly impact.
   Solution: Energy consumption per unit water (due to pressure and reduced flux), chemical and labor costs for cleaning (operational expenditure), and downtime/throughput.

Medium (5)
6. Interpretation: If the plant treats 10,000 m2 of membrane area, calculate the volumetric throughput loss after 30 days for each membrane compared to initial flux (in m3/day). Use initial flux 50 L/m2·h.
   Solution: Initial throughput: 50 L/m2·h × 10,000 m2 = 500,000 L/h = 500 m3/h. Convert to per day: 500 m3/h × 24 = 12,000 m3/day. After 30 days: C flux 30 L/m2·h → 30 ×10,000=300,000 L/h=300 m3/h→7200 m3/day. Loss = 12,000 - 7,200 = 4,800 m3/day. B flux 44 L/m2·h → 44×10,000=440,000 L/h=440 m3/h→10,560 m3/day. Loss = 12,000 - 10,560 = 1,440 m3/day.

7. Cost inference: If lost throughput is valued at operating margin of $0.10 per m3, compute daily revenue loss due to fouling for each membrane after 30 days.
   Solution: C: 4,800 m3/day × $0.10 = $480/day. B: 1,440 m3/day × $0.10 = $144/day.

8. Hypothesis testing: You measure bacterial adhesion densities (cells/cm2) after exposure: C = 1.2×10^6, B = 2.5×10^5. State whether the data support the claim that brush layer reduces bacterial attachment and justify.
   Solution: Yes — bacterial adhesion on B (2.5×10^5) is ~5 times lower than on C (1.2×10^6), consistent with reduced attachment due to brush layer.

9. Data critique: If for membrane B salt rejection decreased slightly from 99.5% to 99.2% over 30 days while C remained at 99.5%, discuss possible explanations consistent with the membrane description.
   Solution: Slight decline in rejection for B could be due to the added polymer brush layer altering effective pore structure or interacting with ionic transport, or partial compaction or rearrangement of brush leading to momentary pathways. Alternatively, fouling of B by specific ions (due to chosen surface charge attracting counter-ions) could slightly reduce rejection. Because B maintains higher flux, trade-offs between permeability and selectivity may cause small selectivity shifts.

10. Design suggestion: Propose one simple additional measurement to corroborate whether the brush mobility, rather than chemistry alone, is responsible for reduced bacterial adhesion in the lab.
    Solution: Measure adhesion under static and dynamic conditions for the same membrane — compare adhesion in no-flow (static incubation) versus under flow; greater relative reduction under flow indicates mobility-related effects. Alternatively compare membrane with same chemistry but crosslinked (immobilized) vs. mobile brush.

Hard (5)
11. Modeling: Assume fouling leads to an exponential decay of flux F(t) = F0·e^{-λt}. Using the observed fluxes at t=30 days (F0=50 L/m2·h), compute λ for membranes C (F=30) and B (F=44). Provide λ in days^-1.
    Solution: λ = -(1/t) ln(F(t)/F0). For C: λ_C = -1/30 * ln(30/50) = -1/30 * ln(0.6) = -1/30 * (-0.5108) = 0.01703 day^-1. For B: λ_B = -1/30 * ln(44/50) = -1/30 * ln(0.88) = -1/30 * (-0.1278) = 0.00426 day^-1.

12. Prediction: Using the λ values above, predict flux for each membrane at t = 90 days.
    Solution: F(90)=50·e^{-λ·90}. For C: exp(-0.01703*90)=exp(-1.5327)=0.2159 → F=50*0.2159=10.8 L/m2·h. For B: exp(-0.00426*90)=exp(-0.3834)=0.6816 → F=50*0.6816=34.08 L/m2·h.

13. Sensitivity analysis: If cleaning restores flux to 95% but cleaning costs $500 per event per 1000 m2 of membrane, estimate annual cleaning cost for the 10,000 m2 plant using the cleaning frequencies from question 4 (B: ~4/year, C: ~12/year). Which membrane yields lower annual cleaning cost and by how much?
    Solution: Cleaning cost per 1000 m2 = $500. For 10,000 m2 it's 10×: $5,000 per cleaning. Annual: B: 4×$5,000 = $20,000. C: 12×$5,000 = $60,000. Savings = $40,000 per year for B.

14. Critical synthesis: Based on the hypothetical performance data and earlier descriptions, write a concise recommendation (~3 sentences) to a plant manager considering retrofit: include performance, economic, and any caveats.
    Solution: Recommendation: The brush-layer membranes show markedly lower flux decline and reduced bacterial adhesion, translating to higher delivered throughput and substantially lower cleaning costs (estimated $40k/year savings for a 10,000 m2 plant) and fewer interruptions. Caveats include verifying long-term salt rejection stability, assessing membrane purchase price premium, and validating performance under the plant's specific feedwater chemistry via a field trial before full retrofit.

15. Experimental extension (design): Propose a 6-month field trial plan (3 bullets: primary objective, key measurements, success criteria) for the brush-layer membranes at a municipal plant.
    Solution: Objective: Compare long-term operational performance (flux decline, cleaning frequency, salt rejection, and energy use) of brush-layer vs. commercial membranes under real feedwater. Key measurements: continuous flux and pressure monitoring, salt rejection tests weekly, record of cleaning events/chemicals, microbial/colloidal sampling, and membrane inspection post-trial. Success criteria: ≥50% reduction in cleaning frequency, ≤15% additional unit cost when amortized over lifecycle, and maintained salt rejection within acceptable regulatory limits.

Exam 4 — Terminology, sequencing, and policy brief
(Instructions: Answer succinctly. Use only the information provided.)

Easy (5)
1. Define: Reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination — 1–2 sentences.
   Solution: RO desalination uses high pressure to force polluted water through a semipermeable membrane; water molecules pass through pores while salts, bacteria and impurities are retained, producing purified water.

2. Multiple choice: "Scaling" in membrane systems primarily refers to:
   A) Increasing membrane size
   B) Deposition of mineral salts on surfaces
   C) Biological growth only
   D) Manufacturing membranes in large scale  
   Solution: B

3. Short answer: What is meant by a "polymer brush layer"?
   Solution: A layer of polymer chains chemically tethered (anchored) to a surface so that chains extend away from the surface like bristles of a brush.

4. True/False: Atmospheric pressure plasma requires a vacuum chamber to function.
   Solution: False

5. Short answer: Name one journal in which the team's findings were published.
   Solution: Journal of Materials Chemistry (and a preliminary paper appeared in Journal of Membrane Science).

Medium (5)
6. Sequencing: Put these steps of the membrane synthesis in correct order: (A) Graft polymerization with monomer solution, (B) Interfacial polymerization to form polyamide thin film, (C) Activation by atmospheric pressure plasma.
   Solution: Order: B → C → A.

7. Short explanation: Why do tethered polymer chains provide more thermal stability than physically coated films?
   Solution: Tethered chains are chemically anchored to the substrate, preventing detachment or flow at elevated temperature, whereas physically coated films can delaminate, flow or reorganize under heat.

8. Matching (match left to right):
   - (i) Fouling
   - (ii) Rejection characteristic
   - (iii) Brush topography
   A) Ability to keep salts/impurities out
   B) Surface structure that affects mobility and adhesion
   C) Accumulation of particles/biofilms on surface  
   Solution: (i)-C, (ii)-A, (iii)-B

9. Short answer: The team mentions being able to "choose the chemistry of the brush layer." Name two membrane properties that this choice can directly influence.
   Solution: Surface charge (thus electrostatic interactions), hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and therefore fouling propensity and specific interactions with foulants.

10. Short answer: Explain briefly why the research team works directly with industry and water agencies.
    Solution: To accelerate translation of technology to real-world solutions, ensure the research addresses practical issues, and provide students with experience collaborating with external stakeholders.

Hard (5)
11. Policy brief (short): Write a one-paragraph recommendation (3–5 sentences) for a municipal water authority considering pilot testing these membranes. Include benefits, a key risk, and a recommended mitigation.
    Solution: Recommendation: Pilot testing the brush-layer membranes is advisable because they promise significantly reduced fouling, higher sustained flux, and lower operational costs through fewer cleanings and longer membrane life—benefits that can improve reliability and reduce energy and chemical expenses. Key risk is uncertain long-term selectivity and performance under the authority’s specific feedwater chemistry, which could slightly alter salt rejection or promote unexpected interactions. Mitigation: conduct a controlled, instrumented field trial comparing membranes side-by-side with robust monitoring of flux, rejection, cleaning needs, and chemical interactions before committing to full-scale adoption.

12. Analytical: The text compares plasma in the "early years" to atmospheric pressure plasma. Summarize the main technological limitation of early plasma treatments and how atmospheric plasma overcomes it. Then discuss one manufacturing implication.
    Solution: Limitation: Early plasma treatments required vacuum chambers, making them impractical and costly for processing thousands of meters of continuous membrane due to limited chamber size and throughput. Atmospheric plasma eliminates the need for vacuum, enabling in-line, non-vacuum "brushing" of surfaces. Manufacturing implication: Enables continuous roll-to-roll processing at industrial speeds, reducing capital costs and enabling scalable production of modified membranes.

13. Ethics/impact: Briefly discuss one social or environmental benefit and one potential environmental concern associated with widespread adoption of these membranes.
    Solution: Benefit: More economical desalination could expand access to potable water, reduce dependence on scarce freshwater sources, and support communities facing water scarcity. Concern: Increased desalination capacity could increase brine discharge volumes; if not managed, concentrated brine could harm marine environments—thus adoption must be coupled with responsible brine management.

14. Research critique: The team proposes selecting brush chemistries for different fouling tendencies. Identify two experimental challenges they are likely to face in creating a robust "membrane selection system."
    Solution: (1) Heterogeneity and temporal variability of real feedwaters (seasonal changes, multiple foulants) make mapping a single brush chemistry to a water type complex. (2) Interactions between surface charge and mixed ionic species or organics may produce unexpected scaling or attraction of counter-ions, requiring extensive empirical testing across many compositions.

15. Integration: Propose (in 4–6 sentences) how the combination of high permeability and anti-fouling could alter the energy footprint of an RO desalination plant, being specific about mechanisms.
    Solution: High permeability reduces the pressure needed to achieve a given flux, directly lowering pump energy consumption per unit water treated. Anti-fouling maintains higher effective permeability over time, reducing the need for increased pressure or higher energy operations to compensate for flux decline. Fewer cleanings and membrane replacements mean less energy spent on cleaning processes and manufacturing/disposal. Together, these mechanisms reduce both operational and lifecycle energy footprints of the plant.

Exam 5 — Case study and project planning
(Instructions: Assume you are the lead engineer proposing a pilot commercialization program. Use only the facts and directions implicit in the research description.)

Easy (5)
1. Short answer: State the immediate technological novelty you would highlight in a funding pitch.
   Solution: Use of atmospheric pressure plasma to create a tethered polymer brush layer on polyamide RO membranes that confers strong anti-fouling and anti-scaling properties while being compatible with continuous, large-scale production.

2. Short answer: Give two direct operational benefits to emphasize in the pitch.
   Solution: Reduced cleaning frequency/chemical use and extended membrane lifetime (lower replacement costs), plus maintained high water permeability and high rejection.

3. Short answer: Name one partner type (organization) you would seek for a field trial.
   Solution: A municipal water agency or an industrial water user with available pilot RO facilities (or industry partners/manufacturers of membranes).

4. Multiple choice: Which of the following is a reasonable first technical milestone for a pilot program?
   A) Full global commercialization
   B) Laboratory proof-of-concept
   C) Continuous synthesis demonstration at pilot scale
   D) Publication in a new journal  
   Solution: C

5. Short answer: Identify one regulatory/quality parameter you must ensure during pilot testing.
   Solution: Maintained salt rejection to meet potable water standards (e.g., relevant regulatory limits for conductivity or ionic concentrations).

Medium (5)
6. Project plan (bullet list): Outline 5 milestones with approximate chronological order for a 12-month pilot commercialization project.
   Solution:
   - Month 0–2: Design and set up pilot roll-to-roll synthesis line (plasma head, monomer application, temperature zone).
   - Month 2–4: Produce pilot-scale membrane rolls and perform QA (thickness, coverage, rejection) in lab.
   - Month 4–6: Install membrane modules in partner plant for side-by-side trials with commercial membranes.
   - Month 6–10: Operate continuous trial, collecting flux, rejection, cleaning frequency, and microbial/foulant data.
   - Month 10–12: Analyze data, prepare techno-economic assessment, and propose scale-up/commercialization decision.

7. Risk assessment: List three principal technical risks for scaling and one mitigation measure for each.
   Solution:
   - Risk: Nonuniform plasma activation across wide web → Mitigation: Use multiple plasma heads and mapping/feedback control to ensure uniform dose.
   - Risk: Rapid deactivation of active sites before grafting → Mitigation: Minimize transport time between plasma and monomer application; design enclosed/controlled atmosphere conveyance.
   - Risk: Altered salt rejection after brush grafting → Mitigation: Optimize brush thickness/topography via controlled reaction time and temperature; perform iterative lab optimization prior to roll-out.

8. Financial estimate (conceptual): Identify three categories of costs to include in a pilot budget and one expected source of cost savings if pilot succeeds.
   Solution: Costs: capital equipment for pilot production (plasma heads, coating/oven), materials and labor for membrane production, field trial operational costs (installation, monitoring). Expected saving if successful: reduced operational expenditure from fewer cleanings and longer membrane life.

9. Stakeholder communication: Draft a one-sentence message to plant operators summarizing why they should allow a side-by-side trial.
   Solution: A side-by-side trial can demonstrate reduced fouling and cleaning needs in your real feedwater conditions, potentially increasing throughput and reducing operational costs with minimal disruption.

Hard (5)
10. Technical proposal (short essay, ~6–8 sentences): Propose a detailed experimental protocol for the field trial comparing brush-layer membranes to the plant's current membranes, including sample size (number of modules), controls, duration, measured endpoints, and statistical considerations.
    Solution: Use at least 6 RO modules in parallel: 3 fitted with pilot brush-layer membranes and 3 with the plant’s current commercial membranes as controls, ensuring identical hydraulic and feed conditions. Operate continuously for 6–12 months to capture short- and medium-term fouling behaviors. Measured endpoints: flux and transmembrane pressure logged continuously, periodic salt rejection assays (daily/weekly), record of cleaning events (frequency, chemicals used, downtime), microbial/colloidal sampling weekly, and post-trial membrane autopsies (SEM/AFM, foulant composition). Ensure randomization of module positions and rotate modules mid-trial if feasible to control for local feed heterogeneity. Statistical plan: use repeated-measures ANOVA or mixed-effects models to compare flux decline rates and cleaning frequency between groups, with significance threshold p<0.05 and power calculation to detect at least a 25% difference in cleaning frequency. Success criteria: statistically significant reduction in fouling rate and cleaning events with maintained rejection.

11. Technical calculation: Assume each cleaning event takes a module offline for 4 hours and causes production loss equal to that module’s nominal hourly throughput. For a plant with 6 parallel modules each of area 1666.7 m2 (so total 10,000 m2), using initial flux 50 L/m2·h, compute the production loss per cleaning event (in m3) for the plant. Then compute annual loss for C (12 cleanings/year) and B (4 cleanings/year).
    Solution: Nominal throughput per module: total area 10,000/6 ≈ 1666.6667 m2. Hourly flux per module: 50 L/m2·h × 1666.667 = 83,333.35 L/h = 83.33335 m3/h. Offline 4 hours → loss per cleaning per module = 4 × 83.33335 = 333.3334 m3. For whole plant if one module cleaned at a time, loss per event = 333.3334 m3. Annual loss: C (12 events) = 12×333.3334 = 4,000.0008 m3/year. B (4 events) = 4×333.3334 = 1,333.3336 m3/year.

12. Lifecycle assessment sketch: Specify 4 data points you would need to calculate cradle-to-grave energy/carbon payback time for switching to brush-layer membranes, and briefly explain how each factor influences payback.
    Solution:
    - Incremental embedded energy/carbon in manufacturing brush-layer membranes vs. standard membranes (higher production energy increases payback time).
    - Change in operational energy consumption (pump energy savings from higher permeability or lower fouling) across plant lifetime (reductions accelerate payback).
    - Change in frequency of membrane replacement and disposal impacts (fewer replacements reduce lifecycle energy and carbon).
    - Change in chemical use and associated emissions from cleaning (less chemical use shortens payback by avoiding production and disposal emissions).

13. Final recommendation (policy + technical, ~4–5 sentences): Given the benefits and uncertainties described, recommend whether to proceed to pilot commercialization, and specify two conditions that must be met before full-scale rollout.
    Solution: Recommendation: Proceed to a structured pilot commercialization—side-by-side field trials are justified given clear benefits in reduced fouling, higher sustained flux, and potential operational savings. Conditions before full-scale rollout: (1) Demonstrated long-term retention of required salt rejection and absence of adverse effects in the plant’s specific feedwater over a statistically robust trial; (2) successful scale-up of uniform plasma activation and brush application with validated QA metrics ensuring reproducible coverage and controlled brush thickness across full membrane widths. If these are met and techno-economic analysis shows lifecycle cost savings, proceed to phased adoption.
