Exam 1 — Objective and short-answer style
Instructions: Answer each task. Use only information given.

Easy (5)
1. True or False: HIV can be passed on when infected blood enters an uninfected person.
2. Multiple choice: Which bodily fluid is explicitly named in the text as being able to carry HIV?
   A) Saliva
   B) Semen
   C) Sweat
   D) Tears
3. Fill in the blank: Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's _____ during sex which carries sperm.
4. True or False: Sharing a toilet seat is listed as a way HIV can be transmitted.
5. Short answer: Name one behaviour mentioned that can transmit HIV.

Medium (5)
6. Multiple choice: According to the text, which of the following scenarios is a described route of transmission?
   A) Two people kissing
   B) Sharing needles between drug users
   C) Swimming in the same pool with an infected person
   D) A hug between an infected and uninfected person
7. Short answer: Explain in one sentence why semen can be a risk for HIV transmission.
8. True or False: The text says HIV can be transmitted through sneezing.
9. List task: Write all bodily fluids named in the text that can transmit HIV.
10. Short answer: Give one reason the text gives for how unprotected sex can lead to HIV transmission.

Hard (5)
11. Analysis: The text lists “blood or semen” as examples of infected bodily fluid. Based only on the text, is it valid to infer that only blood and semen can transmit HIV? Explain your answer in two sentences.
12. Logical negation: Rewrite the sentence “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.” as a logically equivalent affirmative statement (i.e., without “can't”).
13. Short scenario: Person A had unprotected sex with Person B, who is HIV positive. Person A later uses the same toilet seat as Person B. According to the text, which of these events could have transmitted HIV to Person A? List and justify briefly.
14. Precision: The text uses the phrase “unprotected sex.” Based on the text, what specific example qualifies as protected sex (explicitly or implicitly)?
15. Critical: Identify one sentence in the text that defines or explains a term; quote it and say which term it defines.

Solutions — Exam 1

Easy
1. True. (Text: HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.)
2. B) Semen. (Text explicitly names semen.)
3. penis. (Text: “Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.”)
4. False. (Text lists sharing a toilet seat among things it can't be transmitted by.)
5. Example answers: Unprotected sex; sharing needles between drug users; injection drug use with shared needles. (Any one is acceptable; text mentions unprotected sex and drug users who inject and share needles.)

Medium
6. B) Sharing needles between drug users. (Text explicitly: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
7. Because semen can be infected with HIV when someone is HIV positive, and semen can be passed into an uninfected person during sex. (Paraphrase of text.)
8. False. (Text: “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing…”)
9. blood, semen. (Text names those two.)
10. Because when two people have sex without using a condom and one partner is already infected, infected semen can be passed to the other. (Text explanation.)

Hard
11. No. The text gives blood and semen as examples of infected bodily fluid but does not say “only blood and semen”; it uses the phrase “such as blood or semen,” which implies they are examples, not an exhaustive list.
12. Affirmative: “It is not transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.” (This removes contraction; alternative acceptable: “HIV is not transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.”)
13. Only the unprotected sex could have transmitted HIV; using the same toilet seat could not, according to the text. (Text lists unprotected sex as transmission route and toilet seats among non-transmission routes.)
14. The text implicitly indicates using a condom is protection: “for example when two people have sex without using a condom” — so using a condom qualifies as protected sex. (Answer: using a condom.)
15. Example: “Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.” This sentence defines “semen.”

Exam 2 — Scenario-based and applied reasoning
Instructions: Use only the information given. For scenario answers, justify each answer with a reference to the text.

Easy (5)
1. Yes/No: Can HIV be passed on when infected semen is passed into an uninfected person?
2. Multiple choice: Which is explicitly NOT a transmission route per the text?
   A) Blood contact
   B) Sharing needles
   C) Kissing
   D) Unprotected sex
3. Fill in the blank: Sharing _____ between drug users is listed as a transmission risk.
4. True or False: The text equates HIV and AIDS as the same thing.
5. Short answer: Give one phrase from the text that shows a practical example of unprotected sex.

Medium (5)
6. Case: Two people have sex without a condom; one partner is HIV positive. According to the text, describe in one sentence what can happen.
7. Bold inference: The text mentions “blood or semen.” State whether “blood transfusion” is explicitly listed as a transmission route in the text and justify.
8. Comparison: According to the text, which is more likely to transmit HIV: sharing sweat in a sports locker or sharing needles? Answer and justify.
9. Short answer: List three items/activities the text says do NOT transmit HIV.
10. Concept check: The text mentions “infected bodily fluid.” Paraphrase that phrase in your own words using the text's examples.

Hard (5)
11. Scenario analysis: A public sign states “HIV spreads via kissing.” Using the text, construct a two-sentence correction the sign should display.
12. Logical reasoning: The text says semen “can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” Identify and explain any redundancy or imprecision in that clause using one sentence.
13. Design: You're asked to create a single-sentence public-health warning based strictly on the text that differentiates probable from improbable transmission routes. Write that sentence.
14. Proofreading: The original sentence reads “This can happen during unprotected sex. For example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.” Improve punctuation and/or structure to make the sentence clearer without adding new facts; provide the revised version.
15. Critical scenario: Someone argues “If HIV can't be transmitted by sweat and tears, there is zero risk in any casual contact.” Using the text, write a concise rebuttal (one to two sentences).

Solutions — Exam 2

Easy
1. Yes. (Text: “HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.”)
2. C) Kissing. (Text lists kissing among things it can't be transmitted by.)
3. needles. (Text: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
4. No. (The text mentions “HIV” and “AIDS” but does not equate them; it uses “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus,” which is imprecise — but it does not plainly state they are identical.)
5. “when two people have sex without using a condom” (Exact phrase from the text.)

Medium
6. The infected partner's semen can be passed to the uninfected partner, transmitting HIV. (Directly from text.)
7. No, “blood transfusion” is not explicitly listed; the text mentions blood as an example of infected bodily fluid but gives specific scenarios (unprotected sex, sharing needles) rather than naming transfusion. (Text does not list transfusion.)
8. Sharing needles is more likely to transmit HIV according to the text; sweat is explicitly listed among things it can't be transmitted by. (Text contrast.)
9. Examples: coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat, tears. (Any three of these.)
10. Paraphrase example: “bodily fluids that contain the virus, such as blood or semen.” (Uses text examples.)

Hard
11. Correction: “HIV is not transmitted by kissing; it is transmitted when infected bodily fluids like blood or semen are passed into an uninfected person.” (Two sentences, uses text wording.)
12. The clause repeats the idea: “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus” are redundant and confusing because the term “AIDS” normally refers to the disease stage rather than the virus; the wording conflates virus and disease. (One-sentence explanation.)
13. “HIV is transmitted when infected bodily fluids (for example blood or semen) are passed into an uninfected person (for example via unprotected sex or shared needles), but it is not transmitted by coughing, sneezing, kissing, toilet seats, pools, sweat or tears.” (Single sentence synthesizing text.)
14. Improved punctuation/structure: “This can happen during unprotected sex, for example when two people have sex without using a condom and one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.” (Clarified with commas and “and.”)
15. Rebuttal: “The text limits casual-contact risks — it explicitly says HIV can't be transmitted by sweat, tears, or everyday contact like toilet seats — but it also identifies specific bodily-fluid exposures (blood or semen via unprotected sex or shared needles) as transmission routes.” (One to two sentences.)

Exam 3 — Creative formats (produce, evaluate, translate)
Instructions: Stay faithful to the information provided.

Easy (5)
1. List: Write two bodily fluids named in the text that can carry HIV.
2. True/False: The text lists “swimming pools” as a transmission route.
3. Short answer: What example does the text give of protective failure in sex?
4. Multiple choice: Which behavior is explicitly associated with drug users in the text?
   A) Sharing towels
   B) Injecting and sharing needles
   C) Kissing while high
   D) Pool parties
5. Fill in the blank: “It can't be transmitted by things like _____, _____, kissing, sharing a toilet seat…” (fill first two from the text)

Medium (5)
6. Translation/paraphrase: Rewrite in one short sentence the main mechanism by which HIV is passed on according to the text.
7. Evaluate: A sentence reads “HIV is spread by sweat.” Mark as True or False and provide the one-line justification from the text.
8. Matching (match item to category: “Can transmit” or “Cannot transmit”)
   Items: blood, tears, semen, coughing, shared needles, toilet seat
9. Short scenario: Two people share a swimming pool; one is HIV positive. Using text wording, explain whether pool-sharing transmits HIV.
10. Explain: Why does the text mention semen’s role in transmission? Give the functional reason in one sentence.

Hard (5)
11. Create: Compose a multiple-choice question (with 4 choices, one correct) about transmission routes strictly based on the text. Include the correct answer.
12. Analyze language: The text says “when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” Identify two possible problems with that phrasing (briefly).
13. Synthesis: Using only the text, draft a two-line public-health tweet that corrects the myth “HIV spreads through casual contact” and advises one clear preventative measure.
14. Formalization: Translate the following into a single logical implication using plain symbols (use P, Q, R etc.) — “If infected bodily fluid such as blood or semen is passed into an uninfected person, then HIV can be passed on.” State your chosen meanings for symbols.
15. Critical design: Propose one short survey question (yes/no) that would test whether readers understood that sharing needles transmits HIV, and provide the expected correct answer.

Solutions — Exam 3

Easy
1. blood; semen. (Both named in text.)
2. False. (Text lists swimming pools as a non-transmission example.)
3. “when two people have sex without using a condom” (Text provides this example.)
4. B) Injecting and sharing needles. (Text: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
5. coughing, sneezing. (Text: “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.”)

Medium
6. Paraphrase: “HIV is passed on when infected bodily fluids (for example blood or semen) enter an uninfected person.” (One sentence paraphrase.)
7. False — the text explicitly lists sweat among things it can't be transmitted by. (One-line justification.)
8. Can transmit: blood, semen, shared needles. Cannot transmit: tears, coughing, toilet seat. (Matching per text.)
9. Pool-sharing does not transmit HIV; the text lists swimming pools among things it can't be transmitted by. (Uses text wording.)
10. Because semen can carry the virus and is released during sex, making sexual transmission possible when unprotected. (Functional reason per text.)

Hard
11. Example MCQ:
   Question: Which of the following is named in the text as a way HIV can be passed on?
   A) Coughing
   B) Sharing a toilet seat
   C) Sharing needles among people who inject drugs
   D) Swimming together
   Correct answer: C) Sharing needles among people who inject drugs.
12. Two problems: (a) It conflates “HIV” and “AIDS” (disease vs. virus) which is imprecise; (b) saying “carrying the AIDS virus” is ambiguous because the virus is HIV, not typically called “the AIDS virus” in precise language. (Two brief issues.)
13. Tweet (two lines):
   “HIV is not spread by casual contact like hugging, coughing, or pools — it’s passed when infected fluids (e.g., blood or semen) enter another person. Use condoms and avoid sharing needles to reduce risk.” (Two-line tweet, based on text.)
14. Let P = “infected bodily fluid (e.g., blood or semen) is passed into an uninfected person”; Q = “HIV is passed on.” Formal implication: P → Q. (Symbols defined and implication given.)
15. Survey question: “Have you heard that sharing needles between people who inject drugs can transmit HIV? (Yes/No)” Expected correct answer: Yes. (Tests understanding; answer per text.)

Exam 4 — Logical reasoning and error-spotting
Instructions: Answer briefly and base all answers on the information provided.

Easy (5)
1. True/False: The text states that semen carries sperm.
2. Multiple choice: Which of these is NOT listed as safe from HIV transmission?
   A) Tears
   B) Blood
   C) Sweat
   D) Toilet seat
3. Short answer: Name one specific sexual protection implied by the text.
4. True/False: The text explicitly mentions sharing drinking glasses as a transmission route.
5. Fill the blank: “HIV can be passed on when infected bodily _____, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.”

Medium (5)
6. Error detection: The sentence “It can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” contains a redundancy. Explain it in one sentence.
7. Logical classification: Based on the text, is “kissing” classified as a possible transmission route, explicitly non-transmission, or not mentioned? Answer and quote the relevant phrase.
8. Distinguish: The text uses “HIV” and “AIDS virus.” Based solely on the text, is there clear distinction made between the two terms? Explain in one line.
9. Scenario: A nurse says “You can get HIV from sweat during physical contact.” Using the text, write a one-sentence correction the nurse should give to patients.
10. Short answer: Which two activities in the text are given as concrete examples where transmission can happen?

Hard (5)
11. Formal critique: Identify a sentence in the text that is grammatically awkward or ambiguous; rewrite it to remove ambiguity without adding new claims.
12. Inference: The text lists “blood or semen” as examples. Provide two possible logical interpretations of this phrasing (one reading that is narrow, one that is broad).
13. Counterexample task: Provide one plausible everyday action not mentioned in the text that could be mistakenly thought to transmit HIV and explain concisely why the text rules it out or does not rule it out.
14. Construct a syllogism (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) using only ideas from the text that leads to the conclusion “Condoms reduce the chance of passing HIV during sex.” (Keep statements faithful to the text; you may phrase “reduce the chance” as “prevent passage when used” only if justified.)
15. Precision editing: The text says “Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.” Suggest a two-part edit to improve stylistic clarity (state what to change and provide the revised sentence).

Solutions — Exam 4

Easy
1. True. (Text: “Semen ... which carries sperm.”)
2. B) Blood. (Blood is listed as a bodily fluid that can transmit HIV.)
3. Using a condom. (Text example: “without using a condom” implies condoms are protection.)
4. False. (Sharing drinking glasses is not mentioned.)
5. fluid. (Text: “infected bodily fluid”)

Medium
6. The redundancy: “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus” repeats the same idea and conflates disease (AIDS) with the virus (HIV); the phrasing is repetitive and imprecise. (One-sentence explanation.)
7. Explicitly non-transmission. Quote: “It can't be transmitted by things like ... kissing ...” (Text classifies kissing as non-transmission.)
8. No clear distinction; the text uses both terms interchangeably and even says “HIV or AIDS” and “carrying the AIDS virus,” creating ambiguity rather than a clear distinction. (One line.)
9. Correction: “No — HIV is not transmitted by sweat; the text lists sweat among things it cannot be transmitted by.” (One sentence.)
10. Unprotected sex (sex without a condom) and drug users injecting and sharing needles. (Two activities given.)

Hard
11. Problematic sentence: “It can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.” Rewritten: “Semen can be infected with HIV when a person is HIV positive.” (Removes redundancy and ambiguity, does not add facts.)
12. Narrow reading: Only blood and semen transmit HIV (interpreting “such as” as exhaustive). Broad reading: Blood and semen are examples among other infected bodily fluids that can transmit HIV. (Two interpretations.)
13. Example: Sharing a drinking glass — many may think saliva transmits HIV, but the text rules out kissing and lists fluids like sweat and tears as non-transmission, so it implies casual saliva contact is not a listed route. (Explains why text rules it out.)
14. Syllogism:
   Major premise: HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid (such as semen) is passed into an uninfected person.
   Minor premise: Using a condom prevents semen from being passed into another person during sex.
   Conclusion: Therefore, using a condom reduces the chance of passing HIV during sex.
   (This stays faithful: the text contrasts “without using a condom” as risky, so the minor premise is implied.)
15. Two-part edit: (a) Remove the extra “which” and split clauses for clarity. (b) Revised sentence: “Semen is the liquid released from a man's penis during sex; it carries sperm.” (Provides clearer punctuation and removes redundancy.)

Exam 5 — Mixed creative and testing formats (design, justify, apply)
Instructions: Base all answers only on the text provided.

Easy (5)
1. Multiple choice: Which of the following is given as a direct example of infected bodily fluid?
   A) Saliva
   B) Semen
   C) Urine
   D) Tears
2. True/False: The text says HIV can be transmitted through sneezing.
3. Short answer: According to the text, give one non-sexual route of transmission.
4. Fill-in: “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, _____, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.” (fill blank)
5. Short answer: What phrase in the text identifies people who have the virus?

Medium (5)
6. Design: Write a three-word warning slogan that captures one prevention message from the text.
7. Explain: In one sentence, why sharing needles is risky according to the text.
8. True/False with justification: “The text implies that semen is always infectious.” Mark True/False and justify in one sentence.
9. Classification: From the text, classify “blood” and “toilet seat” as either “transmission” or “non-transmission.”
10. Short example: Give one sentence from the text that begins with “It can't be transmitted…”

Hard (5)
11. Debate prep: Write two one-sentence arguments (pro and con) for the statement “Public signs should state ‘HIV is not contagious’” — use only the text to craft each argument.
12. Redrafting: The fragment “This can happen during unprotected sex. For example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.” is clumsy. Produce a single clear sentence that preserves all facts from the fragment.
13. Abstract reasoning: The text lists specific non-transmission items (e.g., swimming pools). Explain in two sentences how such a list limits but does not eliminate the need for clear general rules in public education. (Base the reasoning on the text’s approach.)
14. Construct a two-question true/false mini-quiz (two T/F statements) that tests whether students know both a transmission route and a non-route from the text; provide correct answers and one-line justifications.
15. Synthesis and wording: Compose one precise, single sentence summary of the whole text that could be used in a brochure header (keep to the facts given and avoid added claims).

Solutions — Exam 5

Easy
1. B) Semen. (Text names semen.)
2. False. (Text lists sneezing among non-transmission examples.)
3. Sharing needles between drug users. (Text: “between drug users who inject and share needles.”)
4. kissing. (Text: “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing…”)
5. “HIV positive” or “carrying the AIDS virus.” (Text uses these phrases.)

Medium
6. Example slogan: “Use a Condom.” (Three words; based on text's mention of condom protection.)
7. Because drug users who inject and share needles can pass infected bodily fluid (blood) directly, transmitting HIV. (One sentence.)
8. False — the text says semen “can be infected,” which implies it is not always infectious. (One-sentence justification.)
9. blood = transmission; toilet seat = non-transmission. (Classification per text.)
10. “It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.” (Exact sentence from text.)

Hard
11. Pro argument: “The text emphasizes that HIV is not spread by casual contact (coughing, kissing, pools, etc.), so a simple ‘HIV is not contagious’ sign could correct common myths.” Con argument: “The text also specifies precise transmission routes (blood, semen, unprotected sex, shared needles), so saying only ‘not contagious’ risks understating the real transmission risks and confusing people about when it can be passed on.” (Two one-sentence arguments based on text.)
12. Single clear sentence: “This can happen during unprotected sex — for example, when two people have sex without using a condom and one partner is already infected — or between drug users who inject and share needles.” (Preserves facts, improves flow.)
13. The text’s list of non-transmission items shows concrete counterexamples to common misconceptions, which helps clarify what is safe. However, because the list names specific items rather than stating a general rule, educators still need clear overarching guidance (e.g., avoid exposure to infected bodily fluids) to cover situations not explicitly listed. (Two sentences, reasoning from text approach.)
14. Mini-quiz:
    Statement 1: “Sharing needles between people who inject drugs can transmit HIV.” — True. Justification: Text explicitly lists this as a transmission route.
    Statement 2: “Swimming in the same pool as an HIV-positive person can transmit HIV.” — False. Justification: Text explicitly lists swimming pools among things it can't be transmitted by.
15. Brochure header sentence: “HIV is passed when infected bodily fluids (for example blood or semen) enter an uninfected person (for example via unprotected sex or shared needles); it is not spread by casual contact like coughing, kissing, toilet seats, pools, sweat, or tears.” (Single precise summary staying within facts of text.)
