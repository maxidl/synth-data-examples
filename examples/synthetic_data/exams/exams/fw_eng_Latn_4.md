Below are five different exam styles (you can pick the one you like best). Each exam contains 15 tasks: 5 easy, 5 medium, 5 hard. Every task is immediately followed by a model solution to help grading. The exams are in English.

-------------------------
EXAM 1 — Straight comprehension (mixed short-answer and multiple choice)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Who is the narrator of the piece?  
Answer: A reporter.

2. (Easy) List, in order presented, the three obstacles the narrator crossed/faced on the way into the woods.  
Answer: (1) a mud-ridden stream, (2) flying creatures (fighting to get near her), (3) webmakers spinning her hair into a shiny maze.

3. (Easy) How many leaves did the narrator have analyzed?  
Answer: Five.

4. (Easy) Name three types of trees whose leaves the narrator mentions having found.  
Answer: Oak, beech, sweet gum (tree).

5. (Easy) What is the narrator’s purpose for going into the woods? (one short sentence)  
Answer: To gather fallen leaves.

Medium
6. (Medium) On the leaf-hunting worksheet text, one short descriptive line is printed twice. What is that exact line?  
Answer: "Narrow body with pointy edges"

7. (Medium) For the "Stone Soup" event: what time is lunch scheduled and what time does the show start?  
Answer: Lunch is at noon; the show starts at 12:30 pm.

8. (Medium) Which listed activities explicitly ask for an RSVP and give an RSVP phone number? Give the event names and phone numbers.  
Answer: 
- Tiny Tots Fall for Nature — RSVP: 800/735-2258 (fee $3).  
- Musical Minds — RSVP: 410/266-0677.  
(Also Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature lists 800/735-2258 as the contact.)

9. (Medium) On which dates does the "All Aboard" event occur, and what time does it begin?  
Answer: October 9 & 10, at 2:00 pm.

10. (Medium) What are the age categories for the Nature Designs contest?  
Answer: 3–5, 6–8, and 9–12 years.

Hard
11. (Hard) Two events listed share identical times on the same day and the same park. Identify both events, the shared time, and the park. Why might a parent need to choose between them?  
Answer: 
- Events: "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" and "Spooky Stories in the Woods."  
- Shared time: 10:30 am–noon on Tuesday, Oct. 12.  
- Park: King's Landing Park, Huntingtown.  
A parent must choose because both events run at the same time and are at the same park, so a child cannot attend both simultaneously.

12. (Hard) The "Stone Soup" line begins with "October 9 (11:30am) - Enjoy lunch and a show." Later it says "Lunch is at noon; show starts at 12:30." Using the latter two explicit times, how many minutes elapse between the start of lunch and the start of the show? Show arithmetic.  
Answer: 12:30 − 12:00 = 30 minutes.

13. (Hard) Which phone number appears more than once in the listings, and for which items is it given?  
Answer: 800/735-2258 appears more than once. It is given for "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" (King's Landing Park, Huntingtown) and for "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature" (Battle Creek Cypress Swamp, Prince Frederick).

14. (Hard) Compose a single concise promotional sentence (maximum 35 words) that uses only facts and phrasing from the listings to promote the "Nature Designs" contest. (Your sentence must include the deadline date, the age categories, and at least one of the prizes.)  
Answer (example acceptable): "Nature Designs — Deadline Oct. 15: Create your favorite nature scene (ages 3–5, 6–8, 9–12) to win nature books or statues; bring entries to Wild Bird Center, Annapolis Harbour Center (410/573-0345)."  
(Any sentence that includes Oct. 15, categories 3–5/6–8/9–12, and mentions winners win nature books or statues, and references Wild Bird Center/phone, is correct.)

15. (Hard) From the masthead/header data, give the publication title, the date range shown, and the volume/issue identifiers exactly as printed.  
Answer: Publication: New Bay Times. Date range: October 7–13, 1999. Volume/issue: Volume VII Number 40 | Issue 40.

-------------------------
EXAM 2 — Logic / scheduling / deduction (puzzle style)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Which venue is given for "Stone Soup"? Provide the full line as printed (venue and location).  
Answer: Chesapeake Music Hall, Off Rt. 50 approaching the Bay Bridge: 410/406-0306.

2. (Easy) What is the start time for "Musical Minds" and how long does it last?  
Answer: 4:00–4:45 pm; it lasts 45 minutes.

3. (Easy) Which event explicitly mentions "peanut butter & jelly"?  
Answer: Stone Soup (lunch).

4. (Easy) Which event is explicitly aimed at ages "2–4"?  
Answer: Musical Minds.

5. (Easy) On which date is "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature"? Give date and time.  
Answer: Saturday, October 16 (10:00–10:30 am).

Medium
6. (Medium) Two different activities are listed at "Annapolis Harbour Center." Identify them.  
Answer: "All Aboard" at Zany Brainy, Annapolis Harbour Center; and "Nature Designs" entries are to be taken to Wild Bird Center, Annapolis Harbour Center.

7. (Medium) If a parent wants to attend "All Aboard" and then "Stone Soup" on October 9, can they attend both in full without overlap? "All Aboard" starts at 2 pm; "Stone Soup" has lunch at noon and the show at 12:30. Explain.  
Answer: Yes. "Stone Soup" lunch and show are around noon/12:30 and conclude well before 2 pm. "All Aboard" at 2 pm begins afterward, so a parent could attend both sequentially.

8. (Medium) Find the single listing that includes an explicit entry fee amount (not a price for an event per person like a ticket but a fee indicated as $X). State event and amount.  
Answer: Tiny Tots Fall for Nature — $3.

9. (Medium) Two separate Tiny Tots activities are listed. Give their distinct subtitles and locations.  
Answer: 
- "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature Tues. Oct 12 (10:30am-noon)" — King's Landing Park, Huntingtown.  
- "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature Sat. Oct 16 (10-10:30am)" — Battle Creek Cypress Swamp, Prince Frederick.

10. (Medium) Which event description includes both a food/drink mention and a ranger-led hike? Provide the event name.  
Answer: "Spooky Stories in the Woods" — it says "Hike with a ranger to a clearing in the woods. Listen to autumn stories and drink warm apple cider. Gather leaves to make a craft."

Hard
11. (Hard) Construct a feasible 4‑event afternoon itinerary for an adult with a 3–year-old on Oct. 13 that obeys times, age restrictions, and travel assumptions only within the printed listings (use only printed times/ages/events). Explain any assumptions.  
Answer (one valid itinerary and explanation):
- 4:00–4:45 pm — Attend "Musical Minds" (ages 2–4) at Chesapeake Children's Museum.  
Assumption: The adult and 3‑year‑old go only to the listed event that fits the age and time on Oct. 13; there are no other Oct. 13 events listed. (Therefore itinerary contains the single appropriate event; if travel from earlier/day events were desired, none are scheduled that day in the listings.)

12. (Hard) Identify every unique phone number provided in the listings and map each to the event(s) or location(s) it accompanies. Present the mapping.  
Answer:
- 410/406-0306 — Chesapeake Music Hall (Stone Soup).  
- 410/266-1447 — Zany Brainy, Annapolis Harbour Center (All Aboard).  
- 800/735-2258 — King's Landing Park events (Tiny Tots Fall for Nature) and Battle Creek Cypress Swamp (Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature).  
- 410/535-5327 — King's Landing Park contact for Spooky Stories in the Woods.  
- 410/266-0677 — Chesapeake Children's Museum (Musical Minds) rsvp.  
- 410/573-0345 — Wild Bird Center, Annapolis Harbour Center (Nature Designs drop-off).

13. (Hard) Two events list "bring a bag lunch." Name them and state any extra items requested to bring.  
Answer: 
- Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (Oct. 12) — "Bring a bag lunch to enjoy w/apple cider."  
- Spooky Stories in the Woods (Oct. 12) — "Bring a bag lunch."  
Extra item specified: apple cider to enjoy with the bag lunch is mentioned in the Tiny Tots listing.

14. (Hard) The leaf-hunting worksheet shows several short clues (e.g., "May grow nuts", "Good for sap & color"). From the text, the narrator explicitly lists three tree names she had leaves from. Produce a logically sound short paragraph (2–3 sentences) that connects those three tree names to any of the worksheet clues without inventing facts not in the text. (You may only state what the text allows.)  
Answer (sample acceptable): "The narrator had leaves analyzed from an oak, a beech, and a sweet gum tree. The worksheet includes clues such as 'May grow nuts' and 'Good for sap & color,' which are presented for the reader to match to their own finds; the narrator does not explicitly match those clues to her named trees in the text."  
(Full credit for any answer that mentions the three tree names and correctly states the text does not explicitly assign the worksheet clues to those trees.)

15. (Hard) Design a one-paragraph (3–5 sentences) safety note you would add to the leaf-hunt worksheet that references at least two hazards the narrator experienced and uses wording consistent with the text (do not add new hazards). Provide the final text.  
Answer (example acceptable): "Travel to the deep, dark woods in daylight only and watch your step—mud‑ridden streams can be slippery. Expect flying creatures near trails and be cautious of webs; webmakers may spin into your hair. Bring a companion and keep hands clean after handling leaves."  
(Answers must mention mud‑ridden stream and flying creatures and/or webmakers; minor wording variations acceptable.)

-------------------------
EXAM 3 — Close reading & language tasks
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Replace the phrase "I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze." with an equivalent sentence that keeps meaning but uses the passive voice.  
Answer: "I even had my hair spun into a shiny maze by webmakers."

2. (Easy) What imperative instruction does the narrator give to the reader at the end of the leaf-hunting section? (one short phrase)  
Answer: "Cut out the page and take it with you."

3. (Easy) Identify the three single-word headings (or short headings) that appear repeated at least once in the leaf-hunting worksheet area. (Hint: look for short phrases set off as clues.)  
Answer: Examples: "Narrow body with pointy edges" (repeated), plus other short clue lines such as "May grow berries", "May grow nuts", "Good for sap & color", "3 distinct leafs." (Any three of these count as headings/clues.)

4. (Easy) In one sentence, restate in your own words why the narrator claims "My luck was good that day."  
Answer: Because she found many different kinds of leaves on the ground, including some she had never seen and some in various stages of color change.

5. (Easy) Give the full title line that appears above the leaf-hunting worksheet (the short headline).  
Answer: "Not Just for Kids" (followed by the subheading "The Hunt for Falling Leaves... Nature's Color on the Ground by Mary Catherine Ball").

Medium
6. (Medium) The writer uses a question to engage the reader: "Have you ever hunted for leaves? I wonder if you know the names of five of the trees that live in your neighborhood? I bet the answer is no." Rewrite these two sentences as a single compound-complex sentence that retains the rhetorical effect.  
Answer (one acceptable rewrite): "Have you ever hunted for leaves, and although I wonder whether you can name five trees in your neighborhood, I bet you cannot."  
(Any grammatically correct compound-complex sentence preserving the meaning is acceptable.)

7. (Medium) Identify and correct the single obvious grammatical error in the list of leaf-clues (the worksheet): "3 distinct leafs" — provide the corrected phrase.  
Answer: "3 distinct leaves"

8. (Medium) The author uses short vivid items to list obstacles ("First, I crossed..., Then, I came face to face..., I even endured..."). Name the rhetorical device primarily in use and briefly define it.  
Answer: Parallelism — repeating similar grammatical structures (the sequence "I crossed..., I came..., I even endured...") to create rhythm and emphasis.

9. (Medium) Produce a concise (one-sentence) summary of the "Stone Soup" listing that includes: (a) the date, (b) what to eat, (c) show title, and (d) the performing group.  
Answer: On October 9 (11:30 am), eat peanut butter & jelly lunch at noon and then watch "Stone Soup" performed by the Lost Caravan (show at 12:30) at Chesapeake Music Hall.

10. (Medium) The editorial header shows navigation items printed as vertical pipes separated words, e.g., "| Homepage | | Back to Archives |". Recreate exactly how those two navigation labels appear in the text.  
Answer: "| Homepage |" and "| Back to Archives |"

Hard
11. (Hard) The leaf-hunt copy has several one-line clues. Produce a logically consistent taxonomy (a 5-line bulleted list) that orders those five clues by how easily a young child (ages 3–5) could use them to identify a leaf, from easiest to hardest. For each line give the clue and one-sentence justification.  
Answer (one acceptable ordering; sample):
- "May grow nuts" — easiest: children can relate nuts to trees and may have seen/acorn examples.  
- "May grow berries" — children often recognize berries by sight or touch.  
- "Narrow body with pointy edges" — a simple visual description children can match by shape.  
- "3 distinct leaves" — requires counting and noticing leaflet arrangement (slightly harder).  
- "Good for sap & color" — hardest: requires knowledge about sap usage and autumn coloration, less concrete for preschoolers.

12. (Hard) Rewrite the paragraph beginning "Being a reporter, I am always looking for an adventure..." into a single paragraph of no more than 40 words that preserves the sequence of events (stream, flying creatures, webs) and states the final purpose.  
Answer (sample acceptable): "As a reporter seeking adventure, I crossed a mud‑ridden stream, faced flying creatures vying for me, and endured webmakers spinning my hair, because I had gone into the woods to gather fallen leaves." (38 words.)

13. (Hard) Produce a short analytic sentence (one sentence, 20–30 words) that states the author's tone in the leaf-hunt narrative and cites one textual phrase that justifies your reading.  
Answer (sample): "The narrator’s tone is playful and adventurous, as shown by the phrase 'I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze,' which mixes peril with amusement." (Accept similar sentences that identify tone and cite that phrase.)

14. (Hard) The listings use varied punctuation for time ranges (e.g., "10:30am-noon", "4-4:45pm"). Create a consistent style rule (one sentence) you would apply to the listings, and then rewrite the "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" time entry to match your rule.  
Answer (example rule and rewrite): Rule: "Use a space between time and am/pm, use an en dash for ranges, and place times as 'hh:mm am–hh:mm pm'." Rewritten: "10:30 am–12:00 pm" (or "10:30 am–noon" if keeping 'noon' word).  
(Full credit if student proposes a clear consistent rule and applies it to give a corrected time.)

15. (Hard) Edit the following single-sentence listing into grammatically correct newspaper copy (one sentence): "All Aboard October 9 & 10 (2pm)-Chug a chug to Zany Brainy for train fun. Listen to stories and sing railroad songs. Build your own trains. Ages 3+." Provide the corrected single sentence.  
Answer (example): "All Aboard, October 9 & 10 at 2:00 pm — Chug to Zany Brainy (Annapolis Harbour Center) for train fun: listen to stories, sing railroad songs, and build your own trains (ages 3+)."  
(Any grammatically correct one-sentence consolidation is acceptable.)

-------------------------
EXAM 4 — Data extraction, arithmetic, and planning (practical tasks)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) How many separate event entries (distinct named events) are listed in the program block following the leaf-hunt page? Count them.  
Answer: Seven. (Listed events: Stone Soup; All Aboard; Tiny Tots Fall for Nature; Spooky Stories in the Woods; Musical Minds; Nature Designs; Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature.)

2. (Easy) Which event explicitly lists a monetary admission price for a child activity and what is that price?  
Answer: Musical Minds — $8.50 (fee).

3. (Easy) Which event has the shortest listed duration and what is that duration?  
Answer: "Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature" — 10–10:30 am (30 minutes).

4. (Easy) What date range covers the publication issue?  
Answer: October 7–13, 1999.

5. (Easy) Name the park used as location for both Tiny Tots Fall for Nature and Spooky Stories in the Woods.  
Answer: King's Landing Park, Huntingtown.

Medium
6. (Medium) A family wants to attend every event that occurs on or after Oct. 12 (inclusive) and that lasts no longer than one hour. List which listed events they could attend and the total combined scheduled minutes (sum durations) based only on given times.  
Answer:
Events on/after Oct. 12 lasting ≤ 1 hour:
- Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (Oct 12, 10:30 am–noon) — 90 minutes (EXCEEDS 1 hour) => exclude.  
- Spooky Stories in the Woods (Oct 12, 10:30–noon) — 90 minutes => exclude.  
- Musical Minds (Oct 13, 4–4:45 pm) — 45 minutes => include.  
- Nature Designs (Deadline Oct 15) — not a timed event (no duration) => cannot include as a scheduled event.  
- Tiny Tots get in Touch with Mother Nature (Oct 16, 10–10:30 am) — 30 minutes => include.  
Total combined minutes: 45 + 30 = 75 minutes.  
(Explanation: Only Musical Minds and Tiny Tots get in Touch meet the ≤1 hour criterion and are on or after Oct 12.)

7. (Medium) If a caregiver plans to bring a 3-year-old to events only marked for "Ages 3–5" or "Ages 2–4", which listed events are appropriate?  
Answer: Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (ages 3–5) and Musical Minds (ages 2–4). Tiny Tots get in Touch is for "Tiny tots (2–3 w/adult)" — that would also be appropriate for a 3-year-old if the listing's lower/higher bounds are inclusive; therefore Tiny Tots get in Touch (2–3 with adult) may be borderline since it's exactly 3. If strict: include all three: Tiny Tots Fall for Nature; Musical Minds; Tiny Tots get in Touch (if 3 included).

8. (Medium) For the "Nature Designs" contest: if a child in the 6–8 category wins a place prize of a nature book, and the parent needs the Wild Bird Center phone number, what number should they call?  
Answer: 410/573-0345.

9. (Medium) Determine the weekday named in the Musical Minds listing and the specific festival/location name connected to it.  
Answer: Wednesday (Wed. Oct. 13) — Chesapeake Children's Museum, Festival at Riva.

Hard
10. (Hard) Create a single-day schedule for Oct. 12 for a parent who wants to (a) attend only events at King's Landing Park, (b) bring a bag lunch, and (c) participate in an activity that includes a ranger. Include times as given and total time spent there. Provide a one-sentence justification that this schedule follows the printed listings.  
Answer (schedule and justification):
- 10:30 am–noon — Tiny Tots Fall for Nature (hike into the woods, gather leaves, craft; bring a bag lunch to enjoy with apple cider).  
- 10:30 am–noon — (OR) Spooky Stories in the Woods (hike with a ranger to a clearing, listen to stories, drink warm apple cider, gather leaves; bring a bag lunch).  
Total time spent: 90 minutes.  
Justification: Both listed King's Landing Park activities on Oct. 12 are 10:30–noon; Spooky Stories explicitly mentions "Hike with a ranger," and Tiny Tots mentions "bring a bag lunch to enjoy w/apple cider," so choosing Spooky Stories meets the ranger criterion and either listing covers bag lunch/park criteria. (Note: the student must explain overlap and selection.)

11. (Hard) Compute the number of full days between the issue start date and the "Nature Designs" deadline (inclusive of the deadline date but exclusive of the issue start date). Show calculation. (Issue start date = Oct. 7, deadline = Oct. 15.)  
Answer: Inclusive of Oct. 15 but exclusive of Oct. 7: Oct. 8–Oct. 15 inclusive is 8 days. Calculation: Oct. 15 − Oct. 7 = 8 days.

12. (Hard) Using only the times/timespan info printed, is it possible to attend both "Stone Soup" show and the "All Aboard" program on Oct. 9 if they are held at different venues on the same day? Explain quantitatively (show time boundaries).  
Answer: Yes. "Stone Soup" has lunch at noon and the show at 12:30 (presumably ends before 2 pm), and "All Aboard" begins at 2 pm on Oct. 9. There is at least a 30-minute gap (12:30 show start; if the show is reasonably short or concludes before 2 pm) giving time to travel. Based solely on printed times there is no direct overlap; attendance is possible as long as travel time allows.

13. (Hard) Assume a parent attends Musical Minds with two children and pays the stated fee once per child. How much must they budget for entry? Show math.  
Answer: Musical Minds fee is $8.50 per person (implied). For two children: 2 × $8.50 = $17.00.

14. (Hard) Provide a short emergency instruction (1–2 sentences) that you could print on the leaf-hunt cut‑out advising children what to do if they encounter the hazards listed by the narrator (mud, flying creatures, webs). Use direct action verbs and keep it to two sentences.  
Answer (example): "Stay on dry ground when possible and avoid crossing deep mud; turn back and find a safer route. If flying insects swarm or you hit webs, cover your face and move calmly to a clear spot and call an adult."

15. (Hard) Create a minimal "packing list" (3–5 items) for a child going to the Tiny Tots Fall for Nature activity, using only items or suggestions explicitly mentioned or implied in the text. For each item give a one-line reason tied to the listing.  
Answer (sample):
- Bag lunch — "Bring a bag lunch to enjoy w/apple cider."  
- Adult companion — the event is for "Three- to five-year-olds (and their adult)."  
- Small bag for leaves/craft supplies — "gather leaves and make a craft."  
- Weather-appropriate shoes — to cross mud-ridden streams and hike in woods (implied by terrain described).

-------------------------
EXAM 5 — Creative / synthesis / critique (higher-order)
-------------------------

Easy
1. (Easy) Give the byline (author name) exactly as printed for the leaf-hunt article.  
Answer: Mary Catherine Ball.

2. (Easy) Quote the three-word phrase that introduces the page’s theme: "The Hunt for Falling Leaves..." (use exact punctuation).  
Answer: "The Hunt for Falling Leaves..."

3. (Easy) Which phrase indicates that the leaf-hunt page is intended for readers older than children as well? (one short phrase from the heading)  
Answer: "Not Just for Kids"

4. (Easy) Which city/bridge landmark is used in the Stone Soup location line?  
Answer: The Bay Bridge (Off Rt. 50 approaching the Bay Bridge).

5. (Easy) Which event specifically mentions "Build your own trains"?  
Answer: All Aboard (Zany Brainy).

Medium
6. (Medium) Draft a two-sentence subheading (to place under "Not Just for Kids") that entices adult readers to join the leaf hunt, using only facts or phrases present in the text.  
Answer (sample acceptable): "Travel to the deep, dark woods in daylight to gather fallen leaves—some still green, some changing to autumn colors. Cut out the page, match your discoveries with mine, and enjoy a nature adventure."  
(Any two-sentence subheading that uses only supplied facts/phrases is acceptable.)

7. (Medium) Prepare three bullet-point reviewer comments (each 10–15 words) critiquing the clarity or usefulness of the leaf-hunt worksheet for a family group. Reference text specifics.  
Answer (sample):
- "Clear invitation, but worksheet omits exact tree names for several clues—confusing for novices."  
- "Good safety omission: 'Travel in daylight' is stated, but no clothing advice provided."  
- "Repeat clue builds emphasis (two 'Narrow body…') but could confuse which leaves to find."

8. (Medium) Rewrite the listing header "Stone Soup October 9 (11:30am)-Enjoy lunch and a show." into a compact, newspaper-style heading followed by a one-line subtext. (two-line answer).  
Answer (example):  
Stone Soup — Oct. 9 (11:30 am)  
Lunch at noon (peanut butter & jelly); show "Stone Soup" at 12:30, performed by the Lost Caravan.  
(Any equivalent two-line reformulation acceptable.)

9. (Medium) Produce a three-step family safety checklist (each step one short sentence) for a leaf-hunt based on the narrator’s experience. Use no new hazards.  
Answer (example):
- Go into the woods only in daylight and stay on clear paths to avoid mud‑ridden streams.  
- Move calmly if flying creatures approach and keep faces protected from insects.  
- Watch for spider webs and, if tangled, gently clear hair and seek an adult's help.

10. (Medium) Evaluate whether the phrase "My luck was good that day." is primarily factual or subjective in the context. Give a one-sentence justification with a short quoted example from the text.  
Answer: Subjective — it expresses the narrator’s personal feeling because it follows an account of events ("I was able to spy lots of different kinds of leaves lying on the ground") rather than being an objective measurement.

Hard
11. (Hard) Create a 4‑sentence promotional blurb (suitable for a parenting newsletter) that links one of the listed events to the leaf-hunt activity (you must not invent new facts; you may combine facts from two separate listings). Clearly indicate which two activities you combined.  
Answer (sample acceptable):  
Combined events: "Tiny Tots Fall for Nature" (Oct. 12) and the leaf-hunt invitation.  
Blurb: "Bring your three- to five-year-old to King's Landing Park on Oct. 12 for Tiny Tots Fall for Nature. Hike into the woods, gather fallen leaves and make a craft together. Cut out the leaf-hunt page and match your finds with the suggested clues. Enjoy your bag lunch with apple cider while the kids explore."  
(Any 4-sentence blurb that uses only information from the two listings and references the cut‑out page receives full credit.)

12. (Hard) The piece alternates short, punchy sentences with longer descriptive ones. Identify two examples of each from the leaf-hunt narrative and explain (one sentence) how this rhythm affects reader engagement.  
Answer (sample):  
Short examples: "Being a reporter, I am always looking for an adventure." "Where did I go?"  
Long examples: "First, I crossed a mud-ridden stream. Then, I came face to face with flying creatures, fighting to get near me. I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze." (counted as longer descriptive line)  
Effect explanation: The alternation creates momentum and suspense—short lines pose questions or set tone, while longer descriptions immerse the reader in sensory detail.

13. (Hard) Produce a brief (2–3 sentence) critique focused on the accessibility of the phone/contact information as printed (layout/duplication/clarity). Include one concrete suggestion for improvement derived from the text.  
Answer (sample): "The listings include multiple phone numbers but some are repeated (800/735-2258 appears twice) and others lack labels, which may confuse readers. Suggestion: print each phone number next to a clear event label and include an email/website field for alternate contact."  
(Any critique noting duplication/confusion and giving a concrete suggestion suffices.)

14. (Hard) Draft an alternate closing line for the leaf-hunt page (one sentence) that preserves the tone and invites participation, using at least two words/phrases that appear in the original text.  
Answer (example): "Happy leaf‑hunting — travel to the deep, dark woods in daylight, cut out this page, and match your discovery with mine."  
(Should include phrases such as "deep, dark woods", "cut out the page", "match your discovery", or "Happy leaf-hunting".)

15. (Hard) Imagine you're preparing an accessibility note for visually impaired families who want to participate in the leaf hunt. In two sentences, indicate which two elements from the printed materials you would convert to audio and why, referencing content from the text.  
Answer (sample): "Provide an audio narration of the leaf-clue worksheet (the lines like 'Narrow body with pointy edges' and 'May grow nuts') so families can identify leaves by listening rather than reading. Also record the event details (dates/times/locations and RSVP numbers) so caregivers can plan attendance without needing printed listings."  
(Full credit for any two reasonable elements drawn from the listings with clear reasons.)

-------------------------

End of exams. If you want any exam adjusted (different difficulty balance, different format such as multiple-choice only, or answer sheets separated), tell me which one and I will revise.
