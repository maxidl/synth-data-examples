# Active reading — interleaved with the document
(Reader voice / thoughts are shown as "Thinking:" and margin-style annotations follow each quoted passage.)

## Before Reading
- Preview: Heading says "How do you get HIV?" — looks like a short explanation of transmission. No subheadings or visuals.
- Purpose: I want to confirm accurate transmission routes and identify any common myths.
- Activate prior knowledge: I know HIV is transmitted through certain body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal/rectal fluids, breast milk), not by casual contact (hugging, sharing toilets, saliva generally low risk). Condoms and not sharing needles reduce risk.

## During Reading

> How do you get HIV?

Thinking: This is the central question. I’ll turn it into a more specific question: "What body fluids and activities transmit HIV?"

Margin note: Expect clear list of fluids and activities; check for accuracy and any misleading phrasing.

---

> HIV can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person.

Thinking: OK — mentions blood and semen. Is it a complete list?

Annotations / Questions:
- Which other bodily fluids? (vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, breast milk are also important.)
- "Passed into an uninfected person" — clarify routes (sex, needle sharing, mother-to-child).
- Visualize: blood from a needle, semen during sex, breast milk feeding an infant.

Quick clarification (margin): HIV transmission requires specific fluids in sufficient quantity and access to the bloodstream or mucous membranes. Casual contact is not a risk.

Pause & summarize: This sentence names two fluids but misses others. I should watch for that later.

---

> Semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm.

Thinking: Basic biology explanation. Makes sense, but language could be more inclusive.

Annotations:
- Inclusive note: Semen is produced by people with male reproductive anatomy; sexual partners can include people of any gender.
- This explains why semen can transmit HIV (it can contain the virus).

Question: Does vaginal fluid carry virus too? (Expected answer: yes.)

---

> It can be infected with HIV or AIDS when someone is HIV positive or is carrying the AIDS virus.

Thinking: This sentence is confusing and partly incorrect.

Annotations / Corrections:
- Terminology correction: AIDS is not a virus. HIV is the virus; untreated HIV infection can progress to AIDS (the advanced stage of illness).
- Better phrasing: "Semen (or other fluids) can contain HIV when a person is HIV-positive."
- Question to self: What’s the difference between being HIV-positive and having AIDS? (HIV-positive = infected with the virus; AIDS = late stage with certain infections/low CD4 count.)

Action: If writing or explaining this to others, correct the wording to avoid misinformation.

---

> This can happen during unprotected sex. For example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles.

Thinking: Good — notes major transmission routes: unprotected sex and needle sharing.

Annotations / Notes:
- Add more specificity: unprotected vaginal, anal, or (less commonly) oral sex may transmit HIV — anal sex has higher transmission risk than vaginal sex.
- Injecting drug use: sharing needles/syringes is a well-known high-risk route.
- Prevention reminders: condoms (used correctly), clean needle programs, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), antiretroviral treatment to suppress viral load (undetectable = untransmittable, U=U).

Pause & summarize: This paragraph correctly identifies common ways HIV spreads. I should note prevention options to apply this info.

---

> It can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.

Thinking: Good — dispels common myths. But some small nuances are worth noting.

Annotations / Clarifications:
- Agree: casual contact (coughing, sneezing, sharing toilets, pools, sweat, tears) does not transmit HIV.
- Kissing: deep, open-mouth kissing with significant bleeding from mouth/gums is extremely unlikely but could theoretically pose risk if blood is exchanged; ordinary kissing is safe.
- Emphasize: HIV is not spread by air, water, saliva (in normal amounts), or casual touch.

Question: Should I look up official sources (WHO, CDC) for precise phrasing? — Yes, for authoritative language when sharing.

Pause & quick summary: The document correctly lists non-transmission routes and helps reduce stigma.

---

## Short running summary so far (in my own words)
Thinking: Summarizing helps retention.

- HIV is transmitted through certain infected body fluids (mentioned: blood and semen; in reality also vaginal/rectal fluids and breast milk) via activities that allow those fluids to enter another person's bloodstream or mucous membranes (unprotected sex, shared needles, mother-to-child).
- HIV is not transmitted by casual contact like coughing, sneezing, or sharing toilets; kissing is safe in usual circumstances.
- Correct important terminology: HIV = virus; AIDS = advanced disease stage caused by untreated HIV.

## After Reading

1. Summarize main ideas (without looking back)
Thinking: I'll restate the key points from memory.
- HIV spreads through specific infected fluids (blood, semen, vaginal/rectal fluids, breast milk) during unprotected sex, needle sharing, and from mother to baby.
- Casual contact does not transmit HIV.
- Prevention includes condoms, not sharing needles, testing, treatment (ART), and preventive meds like PrEP.

2. Review annotations
- Noted missing fluids (vaginal/rectal fluids, breast milk) in the document.
- Corrected misleading phrasing about "AIDS virus."
- Highlighted nuance about kissing and extremely low-risk situations.

3. Make connections
Thinking: Connect to what I know and actions I could take.
- If I or someone I know could be at risk, encourage testing and consider PrEP.
- When educating others, emphasize both accurate transmission routes and prevention, and correct myths to reduce stigma.

4. Generate questions (things I'm still wondering)
- What are the exact relative risks of different sexual activities (insertive/receptive anal/vaginal/oral)?
- How effective are condoms at preventing HIV transmission (typical vs perfect use)?
- What local resources provide testing, PrEP, or clean needle services?

5. Reflect on application
- If sharing this document with others, I would correct the AIDS/HIV wording and add the other bodily fluids.
- I could use this to start a short myth-busting handout: list accurate transmission routes and common non-routes.

Final personal action steps:
- Look up CDC or WHO pages to copy exact, authoritative definitions and prevention guidance.
- If needed, get tested or help someone find testing and prevention services.
