# Before Reading
- Preview (skim): Title: "The Independent Jane". No subheadings. Short essay comparing Jane Austen’s themes (freedom, independence) with American founders (Adams, Jefferson). Contains quoted dialogue from Austen's novels.  
- Purpose: I’m reading to understand the author’s main argument about Austen’s emphasis on independence and their comparison to Jefferson. I want to be able to summarize and critique the claim.  
- Activate prior knowledge: I know Austen often explores social constraints, marriage, and individual choice (e.g., Elizabeth Bennet, Anne Elliot). I also know Jefferson and Adams were key American independence figures. I’ll watch for evidence linking Austen’s themes to political liberty.

> The Independent Jane
>
> For all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.

Thoughts / Margin note:
- Claim up front: Austen’s novels are "really about" freedom and independence. Strong thesis.  
- Question: Does the author mean political freedom or personal/social independence? Likely personal/social, but they may draw a political analogy later.  
- Prediction: Expect examples from Austen’s novels showing characters asserting choice.

Pause & paraphrase: The essay will argue Austen’s true focus is individual freedom and autonomy.

---

> Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.

Margin notes / Reactions:
- Concrete evidence: Elizabeth Bennet refuses proposals twice—good examples of autonomy.  
- Quick connection: Standard interpretation — Elizabeth values self-respect and choice.  
- Question: The author says Darcy is "shocked and stunned" — is that characterization accurate? It fits the novel’s reaction.

Comprehension check: Clear. These are solid textual supports.

---

> The freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.

Thoughts:
- Two contrasting examples: Elizabeth defies social pressure; Anne Elliot initially yields to societal advice.  
- Note nuance: Austen’s characters do both—sometimes they assert independence; sometimes they conform. Author acknowledges complexity.

Question: "unusual even for Austen" — is that true? I’d think Austen’s heroines often negotiate society’s rules, with varying degrees of independence.

---

> Although Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.

Margin notes:
- Strong language: "screams" — signals strong critique of social limits.  
- Observation: Author suggests Austen worked within constraints but embedded critique. That’s a common critical reading.

Personal reaction: I agree that Austen critiques gender norms, though often subtly/satirically rather than overtly.

Pause: Summarize so far — The author argues Austen champions personal freedom; examples include Elizabeth’s refusals and critique of women’s limitations.

---

> When accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,
> 
> “Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”
> 
> “Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”
> 
> “I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”

Active reading notes:
- Quote context: This is from Emma — Jane Fairfax defends the labor market for governesses; calls it “sale ... of human intellect.” Powerful phrase.  
- Reaction: This passage explicitly compares the governess situation to slavery language — strong moral critique of the limited options for women.  
- Question: How does Austen use irony here? Mrs. Elton is comic, Jane Fairfax is self-aware and restrained; the contrast amplifies critique.

Paraphrase: Jane Fairfax points out the harsh reality of women selling labor/intellect for survival; Austen is calling attention to systemic injustice.

---

> That same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.
> 
> “Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”

Notes:
- Emma’s reaction displays social stigma about governesses — implies shame attached to employment for women of certain class.  
- Point: The author uses this to show Austen’s attention to constraints on female independence.

Question / critical thought: Emma’s shock is not necessarily Austen’s endorsement; Austen often uses character irony to critique views. The author seems to recognize that.

---

> I find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.

Reader thought:
- Shift in essay: now a historical parallel — Austen’s birth date aligned with early American revolutionary activity. This signals a comparative argument coming.

Clarify purpose: The author will likely compare Austen’s ideas of freedom with the American struggle for independence.

---

> John Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.

Notes:
- Parallelism: Adams goes to congress; Austen is born. The author wants to draw symbolic parallel between political and literary births of independence.  
- Question: Is this juxtaposition persuasive or rhetorical flourish? It’s evocative but not causal.

Reflection: Nice rhetorical device, but I’ll look for substantive connections (themes, rhetoric) beyond coincidence of dates.

---

> Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.

Margin notes:
- Bold claim: Equating Austen’s impact with Jefferson’s.  
- Critical question: Jefferson’s influence shaped political institutions and violent revolution; Austen influenced social attitudes, manners, and literary culture. Are these comparable? The author asserts yes, in kind but different scale.

Consider evidence needed: I expect the author to argue that both promote ideas of personal liberty, albeit in different spheres.

---

> Jefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.

Active reading:
- Acknowledgement of difference in consequences: good—author admits Jefferson’s actions were political and violent, Austen’s were social/literary.  
- Claim: Austen "declared and promoted the same principles"—liberty and self-regulated independence. This is the core comparative thesis.

Question/Counterpoint: "rights of all" — does Austen explicitly advocate "rights" in a universal sense? Her novels are focused on particular social classes (gentry). Could be an overgeneralization.

---

> Jane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Reader thoughts:
- Tension: Austen as "avowed royalist" yet believer in Jeffersonian rights — interesting juxtaposition but speculative.  
- Question: Do we have direct evidence Austen endorsed Jeffersonian rhetoric? The author says "I doubt not" — that's a belief, not a documented fact.

Critical note: This last sentence is more interpretive/hypothetical than demonstrative. It’s permissible in an essay but weaker as proof.

---

Pause — quick mid-read summary (in my own words):
- The essay argues Austen’s novels center on personal freedom and independence, using examples like Elizabeth Bennet and Jane Fairfax to show resistance to social limits. The author rhetorically compares Austen’s influence on social ideas of liberty to Jefferson’s political role in American independence, claiming Austen promoted the same principles in quieter, literary form.

Comprehension check: I understand the overall argument; some claims are interpretive and would benefit from more historical evidence.

# After Reading

1. Summary of main ideas (without looking back):
- Austen’s novels, beneath romance, champion independence of thought and choice. Examples include Elizabeth Bennet and Jane Fairfax. The essay parallels Austen’s literary advocacy for personal freedom with American founders’ political advocacy, arguing Austen’s influence is comparably important though subtler.

2. Review of annotations (key points noticed):
- Strong thesis: Austen = freedom/independence theme.  
- Evidence cited: Elizabeth refusing proposals; Jane Fairfax’s governess dialogue; Emma’s reaction to governessing.  
- Rhetorical device: Juxtaposition of Austen’s birth and Adams/Jefferson to draw thematic similarity.  
- Weaknesses: Some claims (Austen’s belief in Jefferson’s declaration; "rights of all") are speculative; scope of Austen’s advocacy may be limited to certain classes.

3. Connections to other reading / knowledge:
- Connects to feminist readings of Austen that highlight constraints on women and marriage as economic necessity.  
- Reminds me of scholarship arguing Austen’s novels critique social structures via irony and free indirect discourse.  
- Comparison to Jefferson is more rhetorical — akin to comparing cultural vs. political revolutions (e.g., Wollstonecraft vs. Jefferson).

4. Remaining questions / critical queries to ask the author:
- What primary evidence (letters, essays) supports the claim Austen endorsed Jeffersonian rights?  
- Is it accurate to say Austen advocated "the rights of all"? How does that square with her novels’ focus on gentry concerns?  
- Can you show more instances where Austen explicitly promotes individual rights beyond social critique of governessing and marriage?

5. Reflection on application — how I might use this:
- Use this essay’s thesis as a springboard for a class discussion on literary vs. political concepts of liberty.  
- For an essay: refine the comparison by distinguishing spheres (political vs. social) and providing historical/contextual support for Austen’s views (letters, contemporary reviews).  
- For close reading: analyze the quoted passages (Jane Fairfax, Emma) and examine Austen’s narrative irony as a vehicle for critique.

6. Personal evaluation and action steps:
- Strengths: Compelling thesis, good textual examples, evocative rhetorical parallels.  
- Improvements: Add historical evidence for Austen’s political beliefs; temper claims that overgeneralize.  
- Next actions: If I were writing a response, I’d gather Austen’s letters and contemporary critical material to test the Jefferson comparison; also consider secondary scholarship on Austen and political thought.

Final thought (thinking process explicit): I started skeptical about equating Austen with Jefferson, but the essay made a persuasive cultural argument: Austen quietly advocated personal autonomy within social constraints. However, to fully endorse the comparison I’d want more documentary support and clearer limits to the claim (Austen’s influence is different in kind and scope from Jefferson’s).
