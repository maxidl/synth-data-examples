# Jane Austen and the Theme of Independence

## Learning goals
- Identify how independence (of thought, choice, and person) functions as a central theme in Jane Austen’s fiction.
- Analyze key passages that critique social constraints on women in Regency England.
- Compare literary advocacy for personal freedom with political declarations of independence.
- Practice close reading and develop ideas for essays or creative responses focused on autonomy and social expectation.

## Historical and literary context (brief)
- Jane Austen was born in December 1775 and wrote during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period of significant political change (American and French Revolutions) and evolving social expectations in Britain.
- Political texts of the era—such as the American Declaration of Independence—argue for natural rights and self-government. Austen’s novels, while not political tracts, repeatedly explore personal liberty: the right to think for oneself, to choose freely in matters of marriage and vocation, and to accept responsibility for those choices.
- Austen’s work often critiques the gendered limitations of her society through irony, social observation, and character conflict rather than overt polemic.

## Central idea: independence in Austen’s fiction
Austen’s novels repeatedly dramatize tensions between individual freedom and social expectation. Key aspects include:
- Independence of thought: characters who think for themselves and resist conformist pressure (e.g., Elizabeth Bennet’s refusals; Anne Elliot’s struggle with persuasion).
- Freedom to choose: the right to choose a life partner or a livelihood irrespective of class or family pressure.
- Responsibility: the moral and social consequences of exercising freedom, and the necessity of accepting responsibility for one’s choices.

## Two representative passages and commentary

1) Jane Fairfax on the “governess-trade”
> “Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”  
>  
> “Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”  
>  
> “I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”

Commentary:
- Jane Fairfax’s lines expose the limited economic options for genteel women: the governess role is framed as a market for “human intellect,” a phrase that satirically equates an educated woman’s labor with a commodity.
- The exchange contrasts genteel sensibilities (Mrs. Elton’s shocked tone) with a realist’s bluntness (Jane’s comparison to the slave trade), highlighting Austen’s use of irony and social critique.
- The passage emphasizes both the vulnerability of women who must earn a living and the moral ambiguity of the society that permits this exploitation.

2) Emma’s shock at the idea of Jane becoming a governess
> “Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”

Commentary:
- Emma’s reaction illustrates the prevailing social stigma attached to the position of governess: it’s seen as an “indelicacy” for someone of Jane’s background to consider paid employment.
- Austen uses Emma’s voice to expose snobbery and the gulf between social appearance and ethical concern for individuals’ needs.
- The scene further supports the theme of constrained female agency and the social obstacles to independent livelihood.

## Close-reading exercise (suggested steps)
Passage: the Jane Fairfax “governess-trade” excerpt (above).

1. Read slowly and underline words or phrases that carry strong emotional or ideological weight (e.g., “sale,” “human intellect,” “human flesh,” “victims”).
2. Identify the speakers and their attitudes. How do their tones differ?
3. Analyze the rhetorical moves: Where is Austen ironic or satirical? Where is she direct and moralizing?
4. Consider historical context: What real social conditions does the “governess-trade” evoke?
5. Write a short paragraph (150–200 words) arguing how the passage critiques social limitations on women.

Hint for analysis: Focus on how equating intellect with a commodity both dignifies the work intellectually and condemns the economic system that forces women into it.

## Comparative prompt: Austen and political declarations of independence
- Prompt: Compare the way Jane Austen’s novels advocate for personal liberty with the political assertions of natural rights (for example, the American Declaration of Independence). How do literary and political texts differ in audience, method, and immediate effect? How are they similar in values and underlying principles?
- Points to consider:
  - Form: novel vs. political manifesto.
  - Method: indirect social critique (irony, character, dialogue) vs. explicit assertion.
  - Audience and scale of effect: individual moral imagination vs. mass political action.
  - Shared values: agency, responsibility, the right to pursue one’s own life and happiness.

## Discussion questions
- How do specific heroines (Elizabeth Bennet, Anne Elliot, Emma Woodhouse, Jane Fairfax) embody different kinds of independence?
- In what ways does Austen show both the benefits and limits of personal freedom in her novels?
- How does Austen use irony and free indirect discourse to make social critique more persuasive?
- Can literary advocacy change social attitudes in ways comparable to political revolutions? Give examples or counterexamples.
- How do class and gender intersect to restrict or enable freedoms in Austen’s world?

## Activities and assignments
1. Short essay (800–1,000 words): Choose one Austen heroine and analyze how she negotiates family pressure, social expectation, and personal desire. Use at least three textual examples.
2. Creative writing: Write a modern scene (400–600 words) in which a character confronts social stigma surrounding their chosen livelihood. Use irony or social observation to reveal the stakes.
3. Comparative analysis (presentation or paper): Compare one Austen scene about constrained choice with a contemporaneous political document (e.g., an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence). Discuss rhetoric, audience, and intended change.
4. Group debate: “Resolved: Literary advocacy is as important as political action in promoting individual freedom.” Assign teams to argue for and against, using historical and literary evidence.
