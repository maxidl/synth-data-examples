# How HIV is passed on — clear facts

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system. If untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS, which is the name given to the advanced stage of HIV infection. Knowing how HIV is — and is not — transmitted helps prevent infection and reduce fear or stigma.

## Main ways HIV is transmitted
HIV can be passed when certain infected bodily fluids enter the bloodstream or mucous membranes of a person who is not infected. The fluids that can carry HIV include:
- Blood
- Semen (fluid released from the penis during ejaculation)
- Vaginal fluids and rectal fluids
- Breast milk

Common transmission routes:
- Unprotected sex (vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom or other barrier) with an HIV-positive person.
- Sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment that is contaminated with infected blood.
- From an HIV-positive person to their child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding (prevention is possible with proper medical care).
- Rarely, through transfusion of infected blood or blood products (very unlikely where blood is screened).

## What does NOT transmit HIV
HIV is not spread by casual everyday contact. It cannot be transmitted through:
- Coughing or sneezing
- Hugging, shaking hands, or casual touching
- Sharing food, drinks, cutlery or plates
- Sharing a toilet seat or using the same shower or swimming pool
- Sweat or tears
- Closed-mouth (social) kissing

Very deep (open-mouth) kissing is extremely unlikely to transmit HIV except in rare situations when both partners have significant bleeding in the mouth.

## How to reduce the risk of HIV
- Use condoms correctly and consistently for vaginal or anal sex; they greatly lower the risk of transmission.
- Never share needles, syringes, or injecting equipment. Use sterile supplies every time.
- Get tested regularly and know your partner’s HIV status.
- If you or your partner is HIV-positive, effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) can suppress the virus to undetectable levels — when the virus is undetectable, it cannot be sexually transmitted (U=U: undetectable = untransmittable).
- People at high risk can use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily medicine that can prevent HIV infection.
- After a possible recent exposure, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an emergency medication that must be started within about 72 hours; seek medical care immediately.

## If you think you were exposed
- Wash the area with soap and water (for a bite or needlestick). Do not use harsh chemicals or attempt to “flush out” wounds.
- Seek medical care urgently — PEP may be an option if started quickly.
- Get tested for HIV and follow up as advised by healthcare providers.

## Testing and treatment
- HIV testing is the only way to know one’s status. Modern tests are accurate and widely available.
- If a test is positive, early treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves health, prevents progression to AIDS, and reduces the risk of passing HIV to others.
- People on effective ART who maintain an undetectable viral load do not sexually transmit HIV.

## Quick myth-busters
- You cannot get HIV from casual contact (hugging, shaking hands).
- You cannot catch HIV from a toilet seat, pool, or shared food.
- Saliva by itself does not transmit HIV in normal social contact.

If you have specific concerns about HIV exposure, testing, or prevention options, consult a healthcare professional or a local sexual health clinic.
