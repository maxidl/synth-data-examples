# The Hunt for Falling Leaves

Take a walk into the woods, a park or along your street and become a leaf detective. Look closely, touch carefully, and record what you find. This guide gives simple clues, identification help, safety tips and follow-up activities so you can learn about trees while having fun.

Objective
- Find five different fallen leaves and match each to a clue.
- Observe and describe leaf features: shape, edge, arrangement, color, and any fruit or nuts nearby.
- Practice safe, respectful exploration of nature.

What to bring
- Paper bag or envelope (to hold leaves)
- Pencil and clipboard or small notebook
- Magnifying glass (optional)
- Scissors (optional, for trimming paper only) — do not cut live plants
- Camera or phone (optional, to take photos instead of collecting)
- Hand sanitizer or wipes

Safety and respect for nature
- Go during daylight and bring an adult if you are young.
- Do not touch plants you can’t identify (poison ivy grows in many areas; remember “Leaves of three — let it be”).
- Only collect fallen leaves. Do not remove leaves from living plants unless you have permission.
- Stay on paths where possible and watch footing near streams or wet ground.
- Return wildlife, rocks and living plants to where you found them.

Simple scavenger hunt — five clues
Find one fallen leaf that matches each clue. Put the leaves in your bag, label them, and record your observations.

1) Narrow, long leaf with many tiny pointed teeth along the edge
- Note color, size, surface texture, any veins you can see.

2) Narrow leaf with sharp, spiny points along the margin and sometimes red berries nearby
- Look under evergreen shrubs or near holly-like plants.

3) Broad, palm-shaped or star-shaped leaf with 3–7 pointed lobes (often looks like a star)
- Check for five-pointed or multi-lobed shapes lying flat on the ground.

4) Leaf with many deep rounded or pointed lobes; look nearby for hard nuts or acorns
- The leaf may be large and unevenly lobed.

5) Simple leaf with opposite leaf arrangement on the twig (if you can still find attached leaves or compare with nearby trees); often used for syrup and shows bright fall color
- Look for leaves that have 3–5 main lobes and a clear midrib.

Field record (one page per leaf)
- Clue number:
- Date / Time:
- Location:
- Leaf size (approx. cm or inches):
- Shape (narrow, oval, lobed, star-shaped, compound):
- Edge (smooth, toothed, spiny, lobed):
- Color(s) now:
- Nearby fruits/nuts/berries? (yes/no — describe)
- Any other notes or a sketch/photo:

How to use the clues
- Observe leaf shape first: is it simple (one blade) or compound (several leaflets)? Is the blade narrow, oval, lobed or star-shaped?
- Look at the edge (margin): smooth (entire), toothed/serrated, spiny, or deeply lobed.
- Check for arrangement on the twig, if possible: opposite (pairs across the stem) or alternate (one at each node alternating sides).
- Notice fruit on the ground: acorns, nuts, berries, or spiky seed pods help identify the tree.
- Match these features with the clue descriptions.

Common trees you might find (examples and what to look for)
- Birch: narrow, elongated leaves with fine serrations (toothed edges); light bark on the tree; leaves often small and delicate.
- Beech: smooth, elongated leaves with small teeth and distinct parallel veins; leaves are often strong and papery.
- Holly: glossy, narrow to oval leaves with sharp spiny points on the margin and often bright red berries (evergreen in many places).
- Sweetgum: star-shaped leaves with 5 pointed lobes; fall color can be brilliant red, purple or yellow; look for spiky gum balls on the ground.
- Oak: lobed leaves (rounded or pointed lobes depending on species), often near acorns (nuts); leaves may be large and heavy.
- Maple: palmately lobed (3–5 lobes) with opposite arrangement; good for bright fall colors and some species are tapped for sap.

(If you found a trifoliate leaf — three leaflets — be cautious: some trifoliate plants are harmless, others like poison ivy are not. Do not touch them; photograph and ask an adult.)

Activities to try after your hunt
- Leaf rubbing: place a leaf under paper and rub a crayon sideways to reveal vein patterns.
- Leaf press: flatten leaves in a heavy book for a week to preserve them for a nature journal.
- Create a color collage: arrange leaves by size, shape or color and glue onto paper.
- Match leaves to bark: stand near the tree each leaf came from (if you can find it) and sketch the bark, noting differences.
- Write a short story or poem inspired by the color and shape of a favorite leaf.

Questions to think about or discuss
- Which leaf had the most interesting edge? Why?
- How many different colors did you see among your five leaves?
- Which tree would you like to learn more about and why?
- How might the leaf shape help the tree survive (catch sunlight, lose water, resist wind)?

Glossary
- Blade: the flat part of the leaf.
- Margin: edge of the leaf (smooth, toothed, lobed, spiny).
- Vein: the lines that transport water and nutrients in the leaf.
- Simple leaf: a single leaf blade attached to the stem.
- Compound leaf: a leaf divided into multiple leaflets attached to one stalk.
- Alternate arrangement: leaves grow singly at different heights along the stem.
- Opposite arrangement: leaves grow in pairs at the same level on opposite sides of the stem.

Extension ideas for adults and groups
- Organize a short nature program: storytime, leaf crafts, and a guided walk for toddlers.
- Run a leaf-art contest: categories by age with prizes such as books or nature-themed items.
- Partner with a local park or nature center for a beginner tree-identification hike.

Reflection and recording
After your walk, enter your findings into a nature journal or digital album. Compare leaves you collected to field guides or online tree ID resources. Notice how different leaves are adapted to their tree’s life and to the changing seasons.

Happy leaf hunting — observe, respect, and enjoy the colors under your feet!
