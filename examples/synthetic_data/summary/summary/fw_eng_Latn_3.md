Researchers at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have developed a new class of reverse‑osmosis (RO) desalination membranes designed to resist the common problems of scaling and fouling that degrade performance, increase energy consumption, and drive frequent chemical cleaning and membrane replacement. The membranes combine a conventional thin‑film polyamide RO base with a surface‑tethered polymer “brush” layer created by an atmospheric‑pressure plasma activation and subsequent graft polymerization, yielding a high‑permeability, high‑rejection, thermally stable, and long‑lived membrane surface that is compatible with existing commercial production systems.

Problem addressed
- RO desalination forces water through membrane pores under high pressure while rejecting salts, bacteria, colloids and other impurities. Over time, rejected species accumulate on the membrane surface as scale and foulants, reducing permeability and increasing pumping energy and maintenance costs.
- Conventional surface coatings or treatments can be thermally unstable, require vacuum processing, long reaction times, or be impractical for large‑scale continuous membrane production.

Membrane architecture and fabrication process
- Base layer: A standard polyamide thin‑film composite membrane is formed via interfacial polymerization — the same approach used for current commercial RO membranes.
- Surface activation: The polyamide surface is treated with atmospheric‑pressure plasma to generate reactive active sites. Unlike older plasma treatments that required vacuum chambers (impractical for long membrane rolls), atmospheric plasma can be applied continuously and economically — effectively “brushing” the surface with reactive species without costly vacuum equipment.
- Brush formation: Those active sites initiate graft polymerization from a monomer solution to grow a tethered polymer brush layer. Controlling reaction time and temperature during graft polymerization tunes the brush thickness and surface topography.
- Result: A chemically anchored (grafted) polymer brush whose chains are permanently attached to the membrane surface rather than a physically deposited film.

Mechanisms of anti‑fouling and anti‑scaling performance
- Dynamic surface motion: The tethered polymer chains are in constant Brownian/water‑flow‑induced motion. This dynamic, brush‑like topography prevents bacteria, proteins, and colloids from establishing the multiple contact points required for stable adhesion. The researchers liken the motion to kelp swaying in a current: continuous movement and structural heterogeneity hinder attachment.
- Thermal and mechanical stability: Because the polymer is grafted to the surface, it is more thermally and mechanically stable than conventional physically coated polymers that can delaminate or degrade.
- Charge tuning: The brush chemistry can be selected to impart a specific surface charge, enabling electrostatic repulsion of oppositely charged foulants (for example, repelling anionic species by creating a negatively charged surface).
- Combined effect: The topographical motion plus electrostatic repulsion and a physically screened underlying polyamide surface reduce the likelihood of fouling and scaling, prolonging membrane life and maintaining permeability and salt rejection over longer operating intervals.

Performance and advantages
- The new membrane exhibits high water permeability and strong solute rejection, along with improved long‑term stability.
- Its anti‑scaling and anti‑fouling behavior outperforms current commercial membranes in laboratory testing, potentially cutting the frequency and cost of chemical cleaning and membrane replacement.
- Atmospheric‑pressure plasma enables practical large‑scale production since it removes the need for vacuum chambers and lengthy or high‑temperature reactions, making retrofitting or incorporation into existing manufacturing lines feasible.
- Operational benefits include lower energy demand (by preserving permeability and reducing required pump pressure), lower chemical use for cleaning, reduced downtime, and lower total cost of ownership for desalination plants.

Next steps and deployment pathway
- Scale‑up: The team aims to translate the batch/laboratory synthesis into a continuous, large‑area production process suitable for thousands of meters of membrane.
- Optimization: They plan to develop a membrane selection and optimization system tailored to different feedwater sources (seawater, brackish water, waste water) that display distinct fouling and scaling tendencies. By matching brush chemistries and topographies to specific feedwater challenges, membranes can be customized to delay or prevent fouling onset.
- Field testing: Collaborative studies with the UCLA Water Technology Research (WaTeR) Center and with industry and water agencies are underway to evaluate fouling performance under field conditions and address real‑world operational issues.
- Technology transfer and training: The research program emphasizes working closely with industry and agencies to accelerate adoption and to provide students with hands‑on experience in applied water technology development.

Publication and research team
- The findings are reported in the Journal of Materials Chemistry, with a preliminary introduction published in the Journal of Membrane Science. Key contributors include senior researcher Nancy H. Lin (lead author) and Professor Yoram Cohen (corresponding author).
- The work is positioned to bridge university research and practical implementation through partnerships with industry and water management organizations.

Implications
- By reducing fouling and scaling and enabling more economical, scalable manufacturing, these polymer‑brush‑modified RO membranes have the potential to lower the operating and maintenance costs of desalination systems.
- Reduced chemical cleaning, longer membrane lifetimes, and preserved permeability could make desalination more cost‑effective and more attractive as an alternative or supplementary water resource for regions facing freshwater scarcity.
