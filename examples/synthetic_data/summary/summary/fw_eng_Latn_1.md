HIV is transmitted when bodily fluids that contain the virus are introduced into an uninfected person. The most commonly mentioned fluids are blood and semen. Semen is the fluid released from a man’s penis during sexual activity and can carry the virus if the person producing it is HIV‑positive. Transmission can therefore occur during unprotected sex when one partner is infected — for example, when sex takes place without a condom and one partner already carries the virus. Another common route is through the sharing of needles among people who inject drugs, where infected blood can pass directly from one person to another.

The text emphasizes a clear distinction between routes that do transmit HIV and ordinary everyday contacts that do not. HIV is not spread by respiratory droplets or casual contact, so coughing and sneezing do not transmit the virus. Likewise, routine social interactions such as kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming in the same pool, or contact with sweat and tears are not means of transmission.
