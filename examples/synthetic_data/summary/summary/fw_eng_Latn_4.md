Mary Catherine Ball describes a small reporter’s adventure into the woods to hunt for fallen leaves. What began as a simple walk turned into a memorable outing: she crossed a muddy stream, encountered insects buzzing around her, and had spiders’ webs catch in her hair. In the leaf-strewn forest she discovered many kinds of leaves—some still green, others already shifting to autumn colors—some she had never seen before. Curious about the trees around her, she admitted she didn’t know the names of common neighborhood trees, so she had five of the leaves analyzed and identified examples including an oak, a beech and a sweet gum among others.

She invites readers to join a similar exploration: the page can be cut out and taken into the woods (in daylight) to match found leaves with the clues provided. A short set of descriptive clues is included to guide the hunt (phrases such as “narrow body with pointy edges,” “may grow berries,” “good for sap & color,” “3 distinct leafs,” and “may grow nuts”), suggesting characteristics to look for while identifying fallen leaves.
